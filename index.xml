&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the name of this site means can be intuited by breaking down it&amp;rsquo;s constitutive parts and reassembling it. A reflection is quite literally, a &lt;em&gt;bending&lt;/em&gt; (flection) &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; (re). What&amp;rsquo;s bending back is what it &lt;em&gt;flects&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. Just as a mirror &lt;em&gt;reflects&lt;/em&gt; an image produced by a thing, the reflection contains within it an alternative emphasis on the initial thing causing the reflection. This emphasis brings to mind new aspects of the meaning of that thing, which may not be as easily accessible at first consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilderness came to mind while writing a review of the movie &lt;em&gt;Black Narcissus&lt;/em&gt; (1948). In the movie, a group of Anglican nuns, led by Sister Clodagh, attempts to establish a convent in a remote Himalayan palace. However, the isolation starts to unravel their discipline, and in some cases sanity, leading to a crisis of faith. My review of the movie asked a key question about a detail in the film. What was the significance of the Himalayan setting? It&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in its role as a psychological and spiritual &lt;em&gt;wilderness&lt;/em&gt;. It functions on one level as the &amp;ldquo;Orient&amp;rdquo; critiqued by Edward Said; it exists as a Western projection of the exotic and primal, placing the Occident, or the West, as the subject, and the Orient, or the &amp;ldquo;East&amp;rdquo;, as the object (never mind that Said overlooks the fact that the East &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a subjectivity, or a substance). On another level, this &amp;ldquo;wilderness&amp;rdquo; is the same wilderness found in Daoism. It&amp;rsquo;s a space where one encounters the raw, unconditioned, the divine directly, and many others, without the buffers of civilization. More specifically, without the parts of identity one holds that are sourced from civilization. The unmediated encounter, akin to finding the Dao without distortion, can be profoundly dangerous. It dismantles the nun&amp;rsquo;s constructed identities and faith, which is exactly why the story could not play out in the ordered landscape of Britain. The backdrop of a country near the close of colonial rule is the perfect vehicle to let the story play out. The wilderness is not a physical place, it&amp;rsquo;s more like a catalyst that strips away the civilizational persona. All the accrued layers of ritual and doctrine dissolve and force a confrontation with the non-negotiable core of the self and the divine. The result can be a total destruction and unravelling, since the very structures of mediation are shown to be a weak pretense in the face of the real. Do not mistake this as an anti-government/organization position, it is fully possible that this &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; is constituted by the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; state of ordered and mediated human interaction &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt; government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A still from &lt;em&gt;Black Narcissus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us, in a roundabout way, to the New Atlantis. If the wilderness is a space of unmediated encounter where you reflect and find some opportunity or enlightenment, then the New Atlantis is both the initial and implict striving, and the ideal sanctioned result of this encounter. Sir Francis Bacon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; evokes a utopia governed by a type of coherence almost never before seen. So foreign to the conduct of man that it arose from an unknown sea. Symbolically, this was a precursor to America, conceived as a deliberate construction of a new world order, it&amp;rsquo;s rational refuge from the old world&amp;rsquo;s wildernesses that offered a world-historical freedom in the future that, like all other world-historical events, would change the world&amp;rsquo;s social and spiritual substance. Taking this into consideration, let us recall America as consciously adopting Rome&amp;rsquo;s foundational mythos: &lt;em&gt;novus ordo seclorum&lt;/em&gt;— a new order of the ages. This motto appears on the Great Seal of the US as well as the dollar as vindication of its importance. The founding fathers, being so steeped in classical Republicanism (as well as Freemasonry, which deserves it&amp;rsquo;s own dedicated post), saw the Roman Republic as an inspirational ideal. Thus America is the &lt;em&gt;New Rome&lt;/em&gt; as well as the &lt;em&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;. The New Rome is America in active confrontation with the Wilderness. We saw ourselves as inheriting the renewal of Western civilization&amp;rsquo;s highest ideals. This is in contrast to the New Atlantis, the utopian (and technological, but technology is not limited to external tools, it is also the &lt;em&gt;techniques&lt;/em&gt; one develops internally!) dimension of the American project. Yet, here lies a central tension and open question. Rome fell. To be the &amp;ldquo;New Rome&amp;rdquo; is to not only inherit it&amp;rsquo;s mission, but also it&amp;rsquo;s cycle. Will this active confrontation result in the decline all over again, or will America persevere and become the New Atlantis Bacon envisioned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, &lt;em&gt;Reflections in the Wilderness of New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; describes the act of consideration in the Wilderness of New Atlantis, in the Wilderness as the directly encountered being-there of America, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; of everything including this Wilderness itself. This &amp;ldquo;wild west&amp;rdquo; known as America, where a new subjectivity was pioneered, and is still being pioneered, a subjectivity which changed and is still in the process of changing, the Spirit of the world. There are untamed interiors where the self and the real must be confronted directly. These essays are expeditions into that interiority. Contemplations on this site will not be reactionary, nor will they be invoking the empty domain of referentless symbolism. These are writings within the unresolved, and forever resolving, fertile ground of the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Abridged Notes of David P.

Levine's 'Contributions to the Critique of Economic Theory'" /&gt;&lt;h2 id="preface"&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are my stylized notes of David P. Levine’s &lt;em&gt;Contributions to the Critique of Economic Theory&lt;/em&gt;. It is a highly “abridged” version where I have written down how things have made sense to me, and so might contain spelling errors, or invite the opportunity for better wording and formatting. It does not serve as a wiki or anything, and assumes knowledge of certain facts. Facts such as the background of Levine’s work in this text as constituting “Hegelian” methodology, and respective knowledge of Hegel’s methodology, concept(s), and system. It also assumes a general familiarity with the works of certain political economists, in addition to their relevant contributions to what a science of economics should be constituted by and start with. Aside from that, you can go in blind and read this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a series of interconnected problems that haunt the origins of economics, currently extorting it for its truth-value. All of them stem from a single, “generative”, in some sense, issue. This is the inability to conceive of economics as an objective science of social relations, distinct from nature, or, as a function of spirit. Levine’s goal in part 1 of &lt;em&gt;Contributions to the Critique of Economic Theory&lt;/em&gt; is in addressing this problem through identifying its manifestations and systematically establishing the beginning of this science, and its concepts as logically explicated. The first manifestation is the confusion of social need with natural need (or the need of biological subsistence). Classical political economy began by defining its object as the provision of needs, unable to separate socially determined needs from the biologically given needs of subsistence. The resulting question ensues: is economics about the reproduction of society or the reproduction of biological life? Indeterminacy of this kind dooms economics to a fall from grace, from a scientific look at social life, into a naturalistic science of subsistence, being applicable to even animals. While making for a funny premise, and perhaps an insult, that of the economy of alley cats and dogs, it does not establish economics as a science, nor does it describe the phenomenon of economy. Another manifestation of this problem is the misplacing of the locus of economics to the state, as opposed to the family. An escape from the natural determination of the household (Levine cites physiocrats such as François Quesnay who do this) found itself transferring the site of economic activity to the state, conflating economic relations with political relations. As a result, economy here appears as an arm of state policy, as opposed to a system with its own logic (such as value and capital). This does not preclude the possibility of state &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt; of the economy of course, only to cite the logical error in establishing economics as a science of sociality and social relations, which itself is downstream from spiritual being/reality. Another manifestation was conceiving of “wealth” as a surplus above natural subsistence. This traps wealth in civilized societies (here meaning bourgeois or capitalist) as being determined by its physicality. Wealth, in reality, is defined by its social property of being value. This manifestation is a retreat into naturalism. What needs addressing, according to classical thought, is “wealth”. Wealth involves some kind of “multiplication” of needs and object, however classical political economy oft understood this only quantitatively (as in more needs, and more goods) rather than qualitatively as the creation of a new system. This system is the system of needs. Needs here are defined socially and abstractly. There is a &lt;em&gt;qualitative&lt;/em&gt; transformation found in wealth, where it is a totality governed by the principle of value, as opposed to the aggregate of independent objects and needs. Likewise, we find another manifestation in value. This principle governing the system of needs - value - was discovered, however, following from the previous conception of wealth, value was conceived of as an indifference. In this understanding of wealth, there needed to be a principle, or a common social substance, or protocol, call it whatever you want, to make different commodities comparable and exchangeable. This was defined negatively, as the indifference of needs to other needs. A negative definition cannot give a positive or active determination in a system, and so theories such as David Ricardo’s “invariable measure” hit a dead end. This positive determination can be considered a prerequisite for understanding Capital. Finally, there is a manifestation of this problem where the division of labor fails to find its ground socially. Smith correctly identified the “division of labor” as the source of wealth’s increase, but grounded it in the natural “propensity to truck, barter, and exchange”. Another retreat into naturalism which fails to see economy as a &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon. Particularly, it roots this sociality in a natural and psychological (implied positivistic) cause. The social division of labor appears as an outgrowth of a given “human nature” and not as a historically specific social form created by and for commodity production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this confusion, economics has to be re-grounded (or rather, properly grounded). Its proper object needs to recognize itself as not nature, but the specific social forms generated by economic life. These forms develop logically from one another in a necessary sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth -&amp;gt; Value -&amp;gt; Capital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wealth"&gt;Wealth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classical economy begins with need, and so do we. Need is the beginning that contains the fatal ambiguity which dooms political economy, and as such, constitutes the &lt;em&gt;critique&lt;/em&gt; of political economy. This is, after all, a critical philosophy. At least, Part 1 of the book is in some sense. People have needs and so society must fulfill them. This starting point smuggled in the primary confusion mentioned earlier regarding nature and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need has in itself a kind of contradiction. It appears as natural, via thirst, hunger, shelter, etc. But in “civilized” society, needs become abstract, socially determined, and multiplied, and so there are needs for status, culture, variety, etc. Classical economy cannot have it both ways, being both the natural determination and social determination, so we begin with the most immediate category of need as it relates to the object of economy. This would be the concept which is the most immediate, pre-theoretical conception as it corresponds with &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; need. However, even a momentary glance at “need” sees it as &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; socially determined within a system of need. A given &lt;em&gt;hunger&lt;/em&gt; is not a natural hunger, but a hunger in civilized, or capitalist/bourgeois society. Natural need is in a sense excluded from economic science at the outset by the very concept we begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once one recognizes that needs in wealthy or civilized society are social as opposed to natural (as in the case of subsistence economies), one must ask what object it is that fulfills them. The answer isn’t any &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; thing, such as &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; loaf of bread, or &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Funko Pop, since social needs are by definition &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;. Meaning needs in society are of comfort, trend, status, culture, and so on and so forth. A given individual example is not essentially what the need is. The only object which corresponds here to what we are looking for, or an abstract social need, is that which itself is abstracted from particularly. In other words, a single isolated social need does not cut it. There is a &lt;em&gt;multiplication&lt;/em&gt; of need, or the emergence of a system of needs, which defines civilized society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One abstract need implies others. “Professional attire” implies a “job” which implies “commuting” which implies xyz, and so on and so forth. Abstract needs refer to a relationality which the need itself finds itself in. Another way to look at it is to realize that the abstraction itself generates this multiplication of need. For example, the need for comfort generates the need for furniture, which generates air conditioning, which generates entertainment, etc. In being an abstract need, it already implies an existence of a &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; of needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system of needs (culture, to comfort, to status, and so on) requires a totality, or a total world of objects which mirrors its own diversity and interconnection. This total world of objects is wealth. Levine defines wealth as “the multiplicity of objects capable of fulfilling such social
Needs”. He then clarifies that wealth can be considered an aggregate of “use-values”, but what you find is that the “use-value” is itself a component of wealth. The reason for this is that it is not the particular need whose fulfillment was made possible by wealth (the totality of objects which mirrors the system of needs), but the generativity of need which made wealth intelligible and gives wealth meaning in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="value"&gt;Value
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealth is defined as a multiplicity of use-values. We began with “need”, which is in reality abstract need, which has revealed itself to be the system of needs of which needs an object to correlate itself with. Wealth are these aggregate use-values. As mentioned in the introduction, there is a principle of commensurability required. How can these use-values, this world of objects including food, clothing, trinkets, and such, be compared, exchanged, and ultimately integrated into a singular system of wealth? What we know is that the answer does not lie in the use-values themselves. And we know this new principle, or category, does not stay at the level of use-value because use-values are &lt;em&gt;qualitatively&lt;/em&gt; different and so cannot translate to different needs. For example, you cannot measure nourishment in units of warmth. The use-values of the needs of satiation and warmth are not translatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical political economy considers the mode by which needs are fulfilled internal to “wealth” in searching for an answer. The logic which makes implicit what is in wealth &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; is the division of labor. The division of labor is what solves our problem of commensurability, by explaining the material basis of wealth, or in other words, by actually being the thing producing the multiplicity of use-values. There is a connection between the multiplication of needs (the process of needs generating), and the way these needs are produced in society, therefore allowing for a bridging of commensurability. This bridging is recognized by us, and by society, as what the &lt;em&gt;wealth&lt;/em&gt; of nations consists of; the social substance found in, or containing (depending on how you look at it, either is valid) the division of labor creates a system of interdependence wherein the principle is indifferent to the particularity of need and use-value. Levin’s words which sum up the development so far work better than mine: “Thus value, as this social substance, can begin to emerge in a really determinate form, as more than the negation of use-value, only to the degree that it appears as endowed with a positive conception, which is distinguished from its relation to use-value”. We have avoided the issue of the new immanent principle - identified as value - being an immediate non-being of use-value, but containing the indifference of use-value, and also demonstrating a positive principle (which is to be explained subsequently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something which Levine notes, is that classical thinking, as referring to classical political economy, does not actually correctly identify the division of labor as social, instead locating the principle of sociality in the &lt;em&gt;interchange&lt;/em&gt; or exchange of products, as opposed to the laboring activity itself. The only exception to this is a brief mention in the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt;, which still nonetheless is just an exception to the rule established in that work, or as Levine cites, “a prelude to the treatment of the division of labor as the opposition of independent commodity producers constituted in such a way as to establish the laboring activity as purely individual and as possessed of no intrinsic social character”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought leads to a system of “simple commodity exchange”, featuring a fixed system of &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; needs, with a corresponding distribution of production. Exchange in this system is essentially a direct barter, where value has no independent existence. The &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; division of labor, one that defines capitalist society, is one that again is not tied to the system of natural needs, but sees needs as they are truly. Likewise, mutual dependence (or commensurability) is afforded only to the production of wealth in the system of objects. The substance of this mutual dependence, where it is not the particular need but wealth, is value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value cannot remain an abstract substance. It must realize itself (socially). This happens in exchange. In the system of wealth, individuals relate to each other as abstract commodity owners in order to &lt;em&gt;exchange&lt;/em&gt; commodities. Exchange is the moment where value becomes &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; as a social event, or where the abstract equality of value becomes concrete. In exchange, the private, concrete labor hidden in a commodity is recognized as socially necessary labor, or as value. As such, value is not merely &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the commodity as a thing that is valuable. Value is the social relation between commodity owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being of value creates a social equality where everyone is equal as a &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; owner of wealth. The particular needs don’t really matter, all that matters is one&amp;rsquo;s capacity to own and exchange property. Value is the substance of this equality. The “value” of one’s property is the measure of one’s place in this system of social equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commodity has a double being, one as it relates to a particular need (this bread as commodity for hunger), and another as a value, where it relates to its owner as defining the owner as &lt;em&gt;commodity owner&lt;/em&gt;. Its value here is entry into the system of universal exchange, comparable to value being an ID where the system of universal exchange is a club or bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual (as commodity owner) is a particular person, who has specific needs, and a unique life of their own. But as abstract commodity owner, they are defined by the freedom &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; any particular need. In other words, it matters not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you own, but &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you own and can exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is realized to be the system of commodity owners, where each is equated with the other. To be &lt;em&gt;wealthy&lt;/em&gt; to mean one that is positioned within this social network of abstract equality, having the universal capacity to command the labor of others in the form of commodities. Economics studies this specific form. It studies the relations between these self-seeking property-owning individuals, whose mutual dependence is mediated by value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As relating to the individual, although worth noting that this is not the abstract individual of bourgeois thought, need’s fulfillment is only through the interaction of the system of individual commodity owners. The privacy here is in distinction to the aforementioned bourgeois individual because it is not privacy in the sense that the need itself is tailored to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; individual, nor is it referring to any positivistic notion of sourcing the need from the individual. It is private because the individual is forced into privacy by the structure of the economy insofar as the &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt; can only be grasped as a relation to an individual, or as Levine puts it, to “individuality, to the private, self-seeking, commodity owner”. Social determination in this system is “privacy” and “self-seeking”. These are the prerequisite traits for participating in the value system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value being a social relation creates a unique world. In establishing this social equality, it redefines freedom as freedom &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; determination by particular need. You are not free in civilized society by being self-sufficient, you are only free if you have general purchasing power which frees oneself from the needs of trend, hunger, comfort, and so on. Wealth, likewise, is a system of persons as opposed to a collection of objects. The system of commodity owners equates one with the other, and to be wealthy is to be positioned within this social network of abstract equality, such that you are free (implied, &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; things. Freedom is a topic better suited for another blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine ends this section by concluding that classical economists got it half right. They discovered that economy is a social system of interdependent individuals as opposed to the natural household, but then mistakenly treated this system as a political project (the nation-state’s wealth). This blurred the line between the logic of economy and the logic of state. This ambiguity is why their science was called &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; economy, and not pure economic science. Levine’s project sets out to complete what they started, isolating and distilling their project in order to systematize the logic of that social system without the political framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="capital"&gt;Capital
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social totality whose components (commodities) are intrinsically interdependent is known as wealth. Interdependence stems from the division of labor, and so the social division of labor is synonymous with civilized society. Levine states: “The division of labor produces wealth; societies are wealthy and therefore civilized to the degree that they are marked by the development of a division of labor. Labor, as division of labor, is labor accountable to the development of a many-sided interdependence of the members of society, an interdependence which appears as peculiar to society and therefore both a social interdependence and an interdependence which constitutes the relations among the participants as social in character”. Insofar as the division of labor produces wealth by multiplying needs and the commodities to satisfy them, wealth is a social quality of a society organized by the division of labor. This is what provides the basis for classical political economy to ground value in &lt;em&gt;labor time&lt;/em&gt; in order to see how the wealth of society is produced by society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth making itself determinate (as previously mentioned, for it to produce itself in society, or concretize itself in the world) has to involve some sort of process. The issue is that the process was never fully developed by classical political economy. Wealth developed a materialist bent, and as a result, value ceased in becoming the substance of wealth, and instead &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; becomes a materiality which has its origin in the material world, rendering wealth’s concrete existence unintelligible. For example, we find Quesnay (a physiocrat) seeing land as the source of wealth, as value being the materiality of land. This creates a problem in that wealth is connected to the social substance of value, which is on the right track, but that it reduces value to materiality, or its production being sourced in a natural process such as the fertilization of the land. A science of economics as a social phenomenon cannot resort to this kind of naturalism. However, Quesnay saw that land only produces wealth when &lt;em&gt;wealth&lt;/em&gt; is invested in it, and so this revealed a new idea. Wealth produces wealth. Wealth begins to appear in a circular movement. This is the embryo of &lt;em&gt;capital&lt;/em&gt;, where wealth is brought into concrete being by its own act, or by a self-movement. There is an ‘endless cycle through which wealth preserves and expands itself’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth has acquired a new proof of distinction from static aggregate, into self-moving value in circulation. Viewing wealth as a material product ties it to a fixed natural condition, which would limit its expansion. Economic theory as a true development implies a movement away from such an external limit. In the world, the idea emerges that conditions of production are themselves produces, such as land that is improved by investment. This is the only move possible which frees the production of wealth from natural determination. Production becomes a universal and limitless process, where all commodities embody the principle of wealth (and value).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a new problem emerges. Classical thought’s highest point, found in Ricardo, correctly seizes labor as the principle of production, but it relapses by fixing labor’s cost as a &lt;em&gt;natural subsistence&lt;/em&gt; wage. Subsistence then becomes a new external limit on the circulation of wealth, making wealth another surplus over a naturally given cost. This contradicts our goal of wealth as a self-determined (freely) self-expanding process. The true concept of capital emerges only when this limit is overcome, or, when wealth is seen as produced by the advance of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; is wealth investing in its own expansion. In this process, labor is unified with the objective means of itself as a component of capital (self-expanding wealth, the form of value). Labor is then the process where capital produces itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above is the provided pure logical development of what an objective science of economics must deal with. Given that these are the &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt;, the next two chapters I interpret as Levine demonstrating their emergence, or struggle thereof, in the world. In a sense, it is a way of giving immanent critique to positions of political economy in the past, which positions their work as legitimate within the system/science of economics, if not as precursors, then as failed attempts of thought to reconstitute the capitalist economy as a coherent totality of social relations. Likewise, I will only briefly summarize key points from the following two chapters of Levine’s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith’s achievement in the Wealth of Nations is the positing of the social totality as the necessary starting point. He identifies the division of labor as the “differential specifica” (or the key differentiating feature of one species from another species. Note: species here is not referring to the concept of biological species, it is referring to a unique relationship of universal-particular in the form of genus-species) of civilized, or capitalist, society. In doing so, he makes the system of mutual interdependence, rather than the isolated individual, or the household, the primary economic reality. Wealth is thereby redefined from an aggregate or a nation’s physical stock of items, into a relational product of social interconnectivity. Unfortunately, smith re-absorbs this social discovery back into a naturalistic and individualistic ontology. This is his ambiguity, and the flaw that Levine outlines. Smith provides two contradictory accounts of the division of labor’s origin. On the one hand he accounts it as the effect of a pre-social natural or psychological propensity, and on the other as dependent on the prior accumulation of stock, which itself logically morphs into capital (stock expecting a profit). This position is the expression of the bourgeois standpoint. It necessarily &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; presuppose the social result (in this case it would be market society as constituted by interdependent proprietors) as the natural ground (&lt;em&gt;Grund&lt;/em&gt;, referring to the Hegelian concept) of its own possibility. Smith’s insight and his limitation are ironically one and the same. Technically, as are all insights. This would be that the system he articulates is an articulation of the self-misunderstanding of capitalist society. It is capitalist society blindly using its own tools to understand itself. Capitalist society understands its historically specific social forms (such as exchange and abstract labor) as eternal, natural facts of man qua man. This core ambiguity dooms the fate of his value-theory. The labor-embodied theory points toward the social substance (labor is the common element of a divided social production), while the labor-commanded theory is his attempt to make this substance immediately visible in the sphere of circulation, or to find a tangible object (labor-power) that incarnates value. In this attempt, there is a conflation between value-creating activity (labor) with the commodity that bears the capacity for that activity (labor-power). This is a very dire conflation since it masks the capital-labor relation, making profit appear as a deduction after the fact. It is also what allows him, or one, to imagine a simple commodity economy &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to capital, or a theoretical ghost that severs the necessary logical link between value-form and capital-form. Smith thus grasps the system as social, but can only conceive of its logic as an outgrowth of nature, and subsequently its categories (such as value and capital) as contingent additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Ricardo intuits the systematic inconsistency found in Smith. His significance is the relentless, if not admirable, drive to purge political economy of contingencies and fluff in order to establish a single objective law of value. On a rejection of Smith’s labor-commanded measure based on the insistence that embodied labor time is the sole regulator of value, independent of distribution, this made up a giant leap towards conceiving the economy as an internally regulated system with its own laws, as opposed to a concatenation of natural propensities and political logic. Yet Ricardo’s system is built on a materialist foundation. It’s substrate undermines his advance. Ricardo’s put forth the corn model which used corn as the only good to show how fixed land and diminishing returns cause rising rents, squeezing profits and pushing wages to subsistence, leading the economy toward a stationary state. It’s quite famous, at least in economic theory. The source of its infamy unfortunately isn’t recognized as a result of his theoretical commitment in grounding economic law in a physically observable, technical process. In the corn model, inputs and outputs are homogenous physical quantities. The rate of profit appears as a purely technical ratio of corn surplus to corn input, and value seems securely anchored in a tangible, reproductive process of nature. Levine notices this and shows that when Ricardo is forced to abandon this one-commodity world for a multi-sector economy, he doesn’t successfully translate this logic into the social realm of value. Rather, he confronts the crisis of the “invariable measure of value”. This confrontation is initiated by the direct consequence of a negative conception of value as mere indifference. If value is merely the abstract commensurability of different things, one needs a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; (a privileged commodity like gold) to stabilize this abstraction. Ricardo’s search is DOA because it seeks in a particular use-value, the embodiment of a universal social relation, that by definition is indifferent to particularly. His theory hits an impasse. At once, it correctly identifies labor as the substance of value, but it remains trapped in a materialist conception of that labor, and a materialist conception of its measure. He cannot make the final leap to understanding value as a purely immanent social form whose measure is the self-referential expansive movement of the totality, which is otherwise known as capital. Ricardo fixates on a static external measure, which is antithetical to capital’s self-subsuming logic. Additionally, by fixing the wage at a natural subsistence level, he reintroduces an external and biological limit, making capital’s expansion (profit) a residual of nature’s fertility, and not the free expression of itself, or of its own logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="capitals-world"&gt;Capital’s World
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 of Levine’s exploration begins with a framing of nature and capital, then continues to explore the capitalist system as a self-sustaining totality in the context of Ricardo and Smith. I will ignore the first section of chapter 4, because the relationship of economics to nature has already been clarified. The second section defines the principles of capital’s self-expansion. Ricardo’s central question about accumulation is whether it reproduces its own conditions or hits barriers. He sees capital’s existence as dependent on a limitless expansion, with the rate of profit as both the foundation and the rate of accumulation. There are two limits for Ricardo. First is the natural limit, with diminishing soil fertility and rising rents/wages. The next is the social limit, where there is a possibility of overpopulation. In polemics with Malthus (the father of eugenics), Ricardo argues that abstracting from nature, capital is self-sustaining and limitless. Its only barriers are natural and not internal to capital’s social forms. This is revealing of a dualism wherein socially, capital is unlimited, but naturally it is limited by external conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dualism manifests in respectively two conceptions of accumulation’s motive. One is the expansion of value, where profit rate is the goal and accumulation is self-moving. The other is the fulfillment of need, where profit is a means to consumption, or in other words, accumulation is goal oriented. Ricardo ultimately rejects Malthus’s “glut theory” (overpopulation) because he sees production and consumption as an immediate unity, failing to grasp the mediated, potentially crisis-prone totality of capitalist reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure in grasp is essentially treating capitalist production as the absolute mode of production. Capitalist production is abstract and indeterminate, being independent of its concrete social conditions. Ricardo argues there is no limit to demand and that capital can always be reallocated to meet demand. So for example, if foreign trade stops, production simply reorients domestically. This implies that the world market, the national market, and even the individual producer are collapsible into one another. However, this ignores the concrete characteristics of capitalist production! The division of labor, fixed capital, concentration, world market expansion etc. Ricardo basically says capitalist production is individual self-sufficient production, thereby stripping capital of its specific social determination, while implicitly giving individual production a universal character (the mobility of capital). Production for Ricardo is the production of &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;, but he cannot reconcile this with capital’s necessary fixation into particular use-values and means of production (fixed capital). Therefore, he leaves aside concrete determinations to conceive capitalist production as “immediately universal”. In contrast with Adam Smith, Smith begins with the division of labor and recognizes that production requires social mediation and a market, or that production and exchange are mutually conditioned. Smith thus reduces a world economy as necessary to capital, but treats it as a given condition as opposed to resulting from capital&amp;rsquo;s own developmental process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished with where classical political economy goes wrong with capital, Levine goes into the construction of the world economy as an extension of domestic capitalist competition, which is just as misconstrued. Just as individuals compete within a nation, nations compete globally as if they were giant competing capitals, supposedly. Alas, this construction contains the same theoretical problems as the domestic model but at a higher scale of abstraction. For Smith and Ricardo, free international trade follows logically from domestic laissez-faire. Barriers between nations are as irrational as barriers between domestic producers. This assumes that nations are structurally identical to firms, that each specializes according to comparative advantage, maximizing efficiency for all. There is an erasure of the specificity of the nation state which denies that political entities are distinct with class structures, legal systems, and capacities for coercion which firms lack. Although if you’d look at the modern American corporatocracy, you’d think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical thought reduces the state to three duties, according to Smith. These are defense, the administration of justice, and certain public works, such as providing infrastructure that the market won’t supply. There is no &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt; of political will or social ethics, aside from the market, of course. In effect, the state’s role is to sustain the framework for private accumulation. By this logic, the sovereign state is dissolved, national borders, tariffs, and &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; sovereignty become arbitrary aberrations. This conclusion is never drawn explicitly because it contradicts the real historical role of the state in fostering and &lt;em&gt;protecting&lt;/em&gt; capital accumulation. Classical political economy lacks a theory of the political because it collapses the political into the economic, reducing the state to a “night-watchman” of the market, and denying the autonomy of the social, seemingly exhausting it by private interest and exchange. Lacking even more so since it does not have the tools to conceptualize the state as a necessary moment (and as such, given true due objectivity) of capitalist reproduction, or as arising from, yet at least partially autonomous from, the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classical model envisions a global market of competing capitals that produces a “general good” through the “invisible hand” (might have heard of this from the phrase “the invisible hand of the market”). This invisible-hand logic presupposes a pre-established harmony, which ignores things like imperialism and force. Historical capital expanded through colonization and coercion, not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; through free exchange, which also brings up national development asymmetries. Some states enforce “free trade” while others are subordinated through various methods. The state’s role in managing and mediating class conflict is also ignored, it cannot be the “administration of justice” because this calls into question the classes responsible for this administration in the first place, among other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine, after showing these problems, then moves onto showing how that once class antagonisms are introduced, the classical model is proven weak in structurally integrity. The state is not, nor can it no longer be, a neutral referee. The state becomes a site of struggle and a partial embodiment of capital’s interest. Classical thought cannot theorize this because it lacks a true concept of social totality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a model of “pure competition”, the so-called general interest is the unintended outcome of each capital pursuing its self-interest. It is, in a sense, an unconscious compromise/reconciliation. But once labor-power is commodified, a new opposition emerges in the form of capital vs. labor. Now there are two competing “general” claims: the interest of capital (profit, accumulation), and the interest of labor (wages, reproduction). The state is pulled between these claims. It can’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be the executive committee of the bourgeoisie, since it must also manage labor’s discontent to ensure social stability. The state claims to represent the general good, but is structurally tilted toward capital. This is its internal incoherence. Its external coherence is that in the world market, each state promotes its &lt;em&gt;national&lt;/em&gt; capital’s interest, undermining the classical ethos of harmonious global competition. For Hegel, the state is the actualization of ethical life (if that means anything to the reader at least, this is just to compare it to the following reality, or lack thereof), whereas in classical political economy, no such reconciliation is possible since civil society is the realm of &lt;em&gt;atomized self-seeking&lt;/em&gt;. The state is reduced to a functional instrument, and can’t be this sphere of ethical realization. Thus, the social appears as an external, coercive force rather than as the immanent substance of individual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical thought recognizes social classes, of course, such as the classes of capitalist, landowner, worker, etc. But it does so in a contradictory manner. On one hand, classes appear as commodity exchangers (workers sell xyz, capitalist buys it), which fails to capture class as a social totality. On the other, distribution is treated as the physical division of a product, where classes are simply given, natural entities. In Ricardo’s corn model, for example, production appears as a natural unity of corn and labor, obscuring the social antagonism between capital and labor. Class then becomes an external category. It is necessary for describing society, but without a real social determination in the theory, it is rendered unintelligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Levine shows that classical political economy, despite its seeming advances, cannot conceptualize capital correctly as a self-determining (free, at least free to be what it is) social totality. It jumps between naturalizing capital by making its limits external, and abstractly universalizing capital by ignoring its concrete determinations. You can find this in value theory as it looks for a natural measure, accumulation theory as a dual motive of expansion vs consumption, competition and world market where there is a collapse of complexity into individual exchange, and finally the state and class where an inability to theorize them as necessary social forms of capitals own antagonistic development renders them unintelligible, and pits them against the history and reality of how they function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-specificity-of-classical-political-economy"&gt;The specificity of classical political economy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next chapter is mostly contending with the problems of classical political economy’s fixation with nature, and its failure to establish economics as an objective science. Ultimately, the last subsection of the first section of chapter 5 ends with praising Ricardo’s move of equating production with the self-realization of capital. Ricardo abstracts from the concrete circulation and competition among the many capitalists, allowing him to ground exchange in the labor process. But this at the same time severs this grounding from concrete determinations of the capitalist system, making exchange unaccountable. In other words, Ricardo fails in grounding exchange-value in value, or in socially necessary labor time. The failure identified in the domain of production and social determination manifests as a theoretical problem in the domain of value theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical theory then posits labor as the natural substance of value, in exchange for neglecting the value-form itself. Why does labor take the form of value, and how does value become exchange-value? These are questions ignored, and even more, conflating value with exchange-value. Marx criticizes this failure according to Levine, but in his own analysis, in seeking to ground the form in a social substance, sometimes risks being reabsorbed into the classical framework of opposing form (social) to content (natural). The investigation into value culminates in the dead-end of Ricardo’s “invariable measure”, which is a concept presented as a mystical, impossible solution which seeks to measure value by stripping it of its social form (the commodity form). The analysis shows that this approach renders the price system arbitrary and severs distribution from social relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piero Sraffa’s “standard commodity” is presented as a modern counterpart to Ricardo’s invariable measure. It grounds exchange in a “non-human world of technology”, thereby severing distribution and technique from the value-form and the social relations of exchange. This approach neutralizes the commodity form theoretically, but renders the price system arbitrary and fails to explain the necessity of exchange and its social form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classical framework is a contradictory totality. It is defined by a tension between Nature as the self-subsistent, grounding process, and Capital, as self-expanding value. Its core project is to ground the social system of capital within a natural process. However, this attempt “naturalizes” capital. The value of classical theory for a science of economics lies precisely in this necessary conceptual movement generated by its internality, as it moves to grasp the real totality of capitalist relations. This opposition in this tension, the one between Nature and Capital, became the seed of modern economics. Neoclassical theory radicalized the tension by severing the individual from both nature as a totalizing system, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; from the social process of capital. The individual here no longer is a moment within a determining totality. It becomes an abstract, self-determined entity, standing outside any accountable social process, and in effect, making it unfree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neoclassical theory is likewise a retreat from social theory, characteristic of the alienation of this age. Society is reduced to the interaction of pre-social individuals, while the individual is defined by innate desire/preference. The object of this framework is defined by subjective utility. Likewise, all concrete social substances such as class, power, historical relations, etc. are eliminated, leaving only empty abstractions. As a result, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; framework cannot provide a true social theory. It cannot explain the necessity of social and economic forms. It can only model the interaction of externally given, undetermined data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then leads into part 2 of Levine’s book, where the focus is on contemporary thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Experience Fetishism</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/experience-fetishism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/experience-fetishism/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4135/selfie.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Experience Fetishism" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s often that one hears from the hylics, a call to expand the bank of potential experiences to draw from in some effort to be open-minded. The pressure is on to have “authentic” travel epiphanies or try new foods, and submerse oneself in a foreign-yet-familiar environment. How can it be the case that while the world (particularly the Western developed industrial centers) urges everyone to &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; more, we are left feeling emptier and performative in our lives? This failing is certainly not for lack of experiences, or having too &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; experiences. It results from a confusion of two different kinds of interfacing. Our social machinery is designed to sell us a superficial experience while depriving us of direct engagement, only leaving an implicit access point for genuine connection for those who have been enlightened due to a disciplined study, or enlightenment on the topic by way of desperation; a necessity in the face of the superficiality of #mindfulness retreats. For the hylics who claim that this or that experience is a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, for the social media posting of travel around the world to custom tailored tourist destinations, and to the ones thinking them have escaped this superficiality only to unrealize that the superficiality is something intrinsic and not to be found in the object of experience, Seneca the Younger’s observation that ‘we are as much afraid in the light as children in the dark’ serves as reminder to the fact of paralysis. Such a paralysis indicates a new kind of fear to be found in the fear of meaninglessness hidden beneath the gallery of endless consumable experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a confusion, in addition to &lt;em&gt;in part&lt;/em&gt; being a personal failing due to lack of reflection or engagement, is conditioned by a system which is conducive to vapid testimony. This system has been previously diagnosed by thinkers like Walter Benjamin in his text &lt;em&gt;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&lt;/em&gt;. Benjamin observed that mechanical reproduction, which can be defined here as the ability to mass produce perfect copies of a work of art, strips art of its “aura”. An artworks’ aura is its unique presence spatiotemporally, it’s particular novelty in the world. This loss parallels the replacement of a true experience - something that is &lt;em&gt;contextual&lt;/em&gt; and in some cases challenging - with a superficial, reproducible engagement. Take, for example, the Mona Lisa. The “true” experience might involve understanding its Renaissance context and subsequently having a personal, contemplative moment before it. The modern, commodified engagement is often a struggle through a crowd to snap a picture of a surprisingly small painting, a photo which is identical to millions of others, reducing the encounter to a reproducible visual token. Not too unlike the trend of abstraction in various aspects of modern engagement with the world. Here, there is a direct loss of “aura” in favor of a consumable, shareable moment. Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term “culture industry” to describe how capitalism transforms art and ideas into standardized, predictable commodities designed for passive consumption, not active thought or &lt;em&gt;genuine&lt;/em&gt; emotion. Today, this analysis finds its ultimate expression in the “Experience Economy”. The culture industry no longer sells us films or music as it did in the past. Instead, it sells us pre-packaged transformations and unreal enlightenment, which may take the form of films and music, but certainly belittle the very medium of their conveyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curated mindfulness retreat, trips to Bali or the slave state of Dubai, the “must-do” travel itinerary around the world (which is usually just Europe, America, and Japan, with exceptions made for those in the orbit of Western polarity), even the formulaic self-help bestseller are all products of this extended culture industry, and what I term “experience fetishism”. They take the deeply personal human desires of growth and connection and repackage it in standardized, sterilized, &lt;em&gt;purchasable&lt;/em&gt; products, in effect, making this superficiality the default mode of engagement. People start to &lt;em&gt;crave&lt;/em&gt; this superficiality in an effort to feed the gnawing void left by the very introduction of this superficiality. This system does more than sell us &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;, it sells us pre-fabricated versions of our own inner lives, pacifying our longing for depth by offering a convincing (to the hylic) simulation of it. That fear which Seneca spoke of stems from the consumption of these simulations, while our innate need goes unmet. What is described here is a system of displacement. We begin to confuse the marketed simulation of depth for depth itself. Intellectualism transforms into the accumulated experiential objects which mind turns over from one, to the next, indifferently. The defenders of the West on Twitter (which often times are not from the West) have committed the very shameful act of turning their very own history into an amusement park of modern signifiers and ideas about the past. In turn, the defense of such a project is as immaterial as defending one’s own physical body while being immersed in open waters. If not by the forces of nature and metabolism inevitably wearing this defense down, any natural contingency such as a shark or school of venomous jellyfish may decide to initiate its doom, whichever way the wind blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collect signifiers of a meaningful life, whether it is photos or branded merchandise of various “journeys”, all while finding the substance elusive. We become, as Benjamin might have feared, collectors of copies in a world that has made the original encounter seem either inefficient or intimidating. It is not only the “Funko Pop” or “Labubu” collectors that are worthy of derision. Experience fetishism is thus the compulsive pursuit of curated, consumable sensations as a substitute for (and often an obstacle to) meaningful and transformative engagement with the world. It is the reduction of the world to a gallery of commodifiable moments and objects, where the primary value of an activity is its ability to be captured and catalogued as a personal asset, often times to auction in a system and society of spectacle, rather than its capacity to fundamentally alter one’s understanding or character. It transforms the human pursuits of travel, leaning, spirituality, and relationships, pale imitations of what they are, and alienates the objects of experience themselves from their own inner processes and concept. There is a valuing of the immediate thrill and peripheral novelty over the gratifying work of reflection and integration into wisdom. This worth is judged by its social currency, the power to generate envy or admiration, and, in most cases, validation from an external audience. This generates a checklist mentality towards life where one &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; see this, visit that, or try this, driven by social pressure and FOMO instead of curiosity or personal calling. Experience fetish creates a “cult of the must”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fetish is enchanting precisely because it supposedly offers a beatific simplification. It promises the delicacies of life while bypassing the vulnerability, work, and discipline required for these things. Where it casts a spell where the signifier shines so brightly that it obscures the active erasure of the signified, the dispelling is found in the inversion of the result. One must begin with dismantling the enchanted object and embracing the disenchanting work of genuine engagement. Once this is done, a realization occurs where the enchanted object is blindingly apparent that it has been enchanted by Mammon, and this disenchanting effort of inversion unveils itself to be the necessary step in true comprehension and experience. By taking this act, one goes from having an experience, to allowing an experience to have &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, and being permanently marked by it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>From Hegel to Steiner</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/from-hegel-to-steiner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/from-hegel-to-steiner/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/william-blake/the-ancient-of-days-1794.jpg!Large.jpg" alt="Featured image of post From Hegel to Steiner" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkey’s paw of narrative is often that, for as much one wants to convey a particular story, competing narratives tend to be just as true as the one emphasized. At first, this multiplicity seems fatalistic. In the face of manifold stories and frameworks, how can one be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; authoritative report? Northrop Frye has brilliantly pointed out this fatalistic tendency in the domain of literary criticism in &lt;em&gt;Anatomy of Criticism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He accused criticism of having fragmented into a clash of &lt;em&gt;determinism&lt;/em&gt;. Pre-made ideologies, such as Marxist, Freudian, Jungian, and Neo-classical having made their battlegrounds the home of criticism, the work of the critic turned into the work of projecting the allegiances of the critic onto the work itself, rather than for the purpose of comprehension. And truly, this retreat of objectivity into multiplicity, into the mere assertion that one among many frameworks is the real one, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fatalistic. As soon as the report of a work is finished, there is immediately a kind of lack constituted in the very conveyance of the report, a realization that the report is haunted by what it excludes. One that is, of course, supplemented by the inclusion of other reports, as a band-aid to the problem. The indifference found within the claim that this one framework, in contrast to these other many, is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; one framework, is truly doomed to fatality. The reason being that it is an ignorance of the highest kind: a deliberate and premature foreclosure, one that is arrogant and not found within the essentiality of the work, or object. The adherent of a single framework must ignore not only the legitimate insights of rival frameworks, systems, and narratives but, more fundamentally, the &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt; of those rivals. On the other hand, the assertion that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; frameworks are correct is just as fatalistic, posing itself as a tolerant pluralism. To declare all perspectives equally valid is to neutralize all of them, reducing serious conflict to mere difference of opining. The frameworks are not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; different, but they are different in unique &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of ways. This blind universalism doesn’t acknowledge the reality that each framework is exclusively claiming the totality of the development of the work. And so this view commits a different kind of ignorance: it abandons the search for truth, or connection to the work/object altogether, settling for a passive cataloguing of differences. It sees the multiplicity but denies the struggle within it, the very struggle that signals something real is at stake. This is the fatalism of indifference, where the friction from differentiation is smothered into a formal collection. My very wording gives away the solution to this problem- differentiation of what? In the first place, the very fact of multiplicity is a good sign, since it is a clue that hints at some &lt;em&gt;unitary genesis&lt;/em&gt;, some generative act which created this multiplicity in the first place. And likewise, Frye’s response was to invoke a new approach. Frye intended to approach literary criticism as a theory of literature derived from the total structure of literature itself. He attempted to step back from the battle of deterministic frameworks to uncover the generative principles that made literature possible in the first place. The many are not the source, they are the manifestation of a prior, unitary movement that has differentiated itself. The problem, then, is not how to choose between stories or critical schools, or frameworks, or lenses, but how to discover a generative principle from which the story, and the frameworks for judging the story, emanate, and stand with that which they gain meaning from. This is what I aim to. More precisely, the same approach Frye realized is the correct way forward, applied to my intellectual pursuit, is the perfect vehicle which conveys the narrative of my transition from Hegel to Steiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this or that individual can, similarly to a narrative, be interpreted from different frameworks, with all perspectives holding the seed of truth of the life of that individual. At once, my life story is the story of a musician, the story of a scientist, or scientifically minded person, the story of an appreciator of the humanity, and the story of an unofficial comedian (which probably has to do more with being American than any individual attribution) to name a few. However, once the higher unity of these narratives and reports are grasped, this situation is not viewed as a monkey’s paw, but as the opportunity for revelation, a testament to something created. This became the central pursuit of my intellectual life: to move from observing the myriad frameworks (the very battle Frye catalogued) to seeking the single, dynamic ground that makes frameworks possible at all. Likewise, this ground, or process, in the world (read: uni-verse), is the same process which is reflected in me as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief stint of my teenage years was spent reading, watching, and trying to parse the meaning of everything I could get my hands on, no matter how foreign or crazy. I’m ready to declare this attitude the furnace powering my search, and the most important outlook any given individual can have in life. And so I was led, almost gravitically by principle, as rain drops towards earth, into the realm of philosophy. This &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; called “philosophy” made promises to me about how to understand and comprehend the world. Implicitly, it made promises of teaching me that principle in the world that I was seeking. I jumped from phenomenology, to politics, to epistemology, and finally to Marx, propelled by a series of failed promises to teach me, which rather than left me in disappointment, only fueled the aforementioned furnace, so to say. In hindsight, I don’t regret any of this period. It’s for the very reason that I have experienced my &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; past, that the seed of truth wrapped in each encounter developed not only my intellectual life, but the person I am as a whole, and the person I aspire to be. It was Marx, really, who was in a sense the one that baptized me. Baptized me to the corpus of the only individual who made the genesis and unity, described earlier, the sole subject of his work: G.W.F. Hegel. This, in addition to what I can only call a very emotional, religious moment many years ago, where I retroactively describe it as actually feeling and grasping the unity of being, to the point where it brought me to tears, (which is another story for another time), prepared me to read the works of Hegel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gustave Courbet, The Stone Breakers (1849)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stone Breakers&lt;/em&gt; is here to represent the spiritual moment in physicality (depicting labor here, but not exclusive to it) before entering a philosophic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s project did not arise out of the ether, he was responding to something very important during his time. The response was to the fundamental crisis in post-Kantian philosophy: the separation between thinking and being, or between subject and object. This philosophical trend of Kant’s is known as subjective idealism, and the critical-philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a brief overview of ideality, and what idealism is, is necessary. I can forgive myself for the brief overview of these monumental thinkers, but what I can’t forgive is overlooking key details in an overview of this brevity. The reason a working comprehension of ideality is necessary, is because the trends characterized by idealism circumvent many of the more basic positions in philosophy, positions which are not covered in this article. When one says the “Idea” of this or that thing, a subjective idealism, or an objective idealism, an understanding needs to be conveyed as to what kind of standpoint this “Idea” is. Idealism, contrary to the notion that it denies the physical world, is the philosophical position that the &lt;em&gt;formative whole&lt;/em&gt; is prior, ontologically, to it’s constituted parts. It asserts that the organizing principle or totality (if all is truly unified, the organizing principle and the totality share a very intimate relationship), is more real, or on a higher level or priority than those aggregate elements. For example, a family isn’t merely a random female, a male, and a child. Those parts arranged by the ideal, or concept of “family” as a functional unity that determines their form and connection, a principle of kinship, shared life, and mutual responsibility to the whole, which shapes the roles, bonds, and identities of its members. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; what a family is; the individuals become mother, father, child, or sibling not through biology alone (although it is through “biology”, or the external world/nature that this happens), but by participating in this living, purposeful whole that gives their relations and meaning. The individuals find their specific roles and relational significance only within this prior, unifying idea. Ideality is the active structuring force of reality itself, from Kant’s subjective categories to absolute Spirit unfolding in the world. Any true philosophy has this moment of ideality, as Hegel says below: (And this is a bit premature, but I can’t help myself, Steiner radicalizes this further: the Idea is not logic, but a living spiritual activity whose true knowledge necessitates the movement from “thought”, as unified with abstract thinking and generative process, to perceiving its being, or creative act, directly. This fulfills Idealism’s promise by moving from philosophy to spiritual science).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the truth of the finite is rather its ideality. Similarly, the infinite of understanding, which is coordinated with the finite, is itself only one of two finites, no whole truth, but a non-substantial element. This ideality of the finite is the chief maxim of philosophy; and for that reason every genuine philosophy is idealism. But everything depends upon not taking for the infinite what, in the very terms of its characterisation, is at the same time made a particular and finite. For this, reason we have bestowed a greater amount of attention on this. distinction. The fundamental notion of philosophy, the genuine infinite, depends upon it. The distinction is cleared up by the simple, and for that reason seemingly insignificant, but incontrovertible reflections contained in the first paragraph of this section.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;—G. W. F. Hegel, Encyclopedia Logic&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we find ourselves with Kant. His philosophy emerged from a crisis of certainty. Earlier in the timeline of man, it was believed that man experienced thought and perception as unified with the world’s essence/noumena/being (all three are terms hold essentially the same functional role here). But by Kant’s time, consciousness had become more self-enclosed, the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; experienced itself as alienated from the external, objective world. And so, with rigorous honesty, he analyzed this condition and concluded that what we can know are phenomena, which are the appearances structured by our own innate cognitive categories (you might know them as the forms of intuition: space, and time, and causality). The reason this is termed the “critical philosophy” is because it did not seek to build a positive system about reality, instead, it undertook the critique of pure reason. It was an investigation into the boundaries and valid domains of human knowledge. The task of this critique was to judge what reason can and cannot legitimately claim to know. Kant’s project withdrew from the attempt to know ideality, or spirit, and the supersensible, declaring it off limits to theoretical reason. In the sense that it is limitative and self-examining, it is establishing a critique, or trial, for reason, that forbids it from entering into transcendent speculation. I was informed by my friend Warq that a comical result of this is that in &lt;em&gt;Dreams of a Spirit-Seer&lt;/em&gt;, Kant is very indecisive on Swedenborg (a mystic who could perceive ideality, or spiritual realities), jumping from “this is bullshit” to “ok maybe this could be real”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “thing-in-itself” (Ding-an-sich), or the external world, remains outside our grasp because we cannot get outside our own subjective apparatus to know reality directly, according to Kant. You might recognize this perspective as the essential expression of everyday modern consciousness today. It’s quite shameful that in terms of intellect, the prevailing orthodoxy of our time has yet to seriously contended with Kant. Instead, it urges a weaker claim: that because our perceptions are mediated not even by the categories of understanding, but merely by fallible sense organs, we can never truly know reality. We have managed to inherit Kant’s conclusions, the unknowability of the thing-in-itself, while abandoning the rigorous critique that led him there. And so Kant had established that cognition is limited to phenomena. The thing-in-itself, or noumena, is declared unknowable. This created a dualism where thought was confined to the categories of the subject, and that properties are sourced from the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, the subject, onto the object. To put it another way, Kant recognized that reason seeks an ultimate ground, or unconditioned cause, something free from both the chain of causality, and the chain of conditions (such as the vetting process of the categories and forms of intuition) which is bound with the subject in the knowledge-process. He sought what governed the phenomenal world. And so this “unconditioned unconditioned” is the &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt;, self-sufficient being that would complete the edifice of knowledge. God, the totality of noumena, freedom, reason, the soul are all contenders for this unconditioned. However, Kant made this formulation a regulative ideal, a necessary goal that guides and structures our inquiry but can never become a constitutive object of knowledge. To claim knowledge of the unconditioned world would be to transcend the very conditions of possible experience, which is impossible for Kant. The search is both innate and futile within his framework. It is dead on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these are harsh words to formerly name this trend, it is properly known as subjective idealism. All knowledge is contingent on the forms and categories of the subject. The properties we attribute to the world like causality, aren’t discovered in the object, but are contributed by the I. There is a split between the subject, which is thinking (engaging in generative activity), and on the other hand an unknowable reality. Kant correctly described the thinking subject’s feeling of separation from the world, but mistook this historically conditioned state as an absolute epistemological (what we can know) limit. The critical philosophy creates a yearning for the unconditioned, that immediately declares itself hopeless in achieving, and so the Spirit of the Kantian is one of dialectic, of restless contradiction. Subsequent thinkers struggled with this divide. Philosophy was trapped in what Steiner would call, a “mere thought-system &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the world” unable to claim it was knowing reality itself. Thinking was seen as a subjective activity, the activity of the ego, not connected to the world’s objective essence, or noumenal reality. Because of this, there was a deep implicit striving in philosophy to reunite with the spiritual wellspring of existence, of being, to overcome the feeling that the human spirit confronts a foreign external world. Hegel ultimately sought to heal this rupture, and would go on to reveal that the true character of the unconditioned unconditioned, the principle in, of, and out of this world, is &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831), known as the “last great system builder”, was a German philosopher whose systematic work represents the pinnacle of German Idealism, and the pinnacle of philosophy. After studying theology at Tübingen, he worked as a tutor and university lecturer in Jena, Heidelberg, and finally Berlin, where he served as professor of philosophy until his death. His major works: The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), The Science of Logic (1812-16), and the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1817), were published relatively late in his life and career. Hegel’s dense, demanding system aimed to explain the possibility of knowledge, and unify all domains of knowledge including but not limited to logic, nature, history, art, religion, and philosophy, within the self-unfolding of this thing called &amp;ldquo;Absolute Spirit&amp;rdquo;. Hegel saw the restlessness inherent in Kant’s system and aimed to resolve it by reconceiving the unconditioned. For Hegel, the unconditioned is not a remote “thing‑in‑itself,” but the very process of mediation itself. It is Reason in it’s self-active unfolding. This Reason is not a subjective faculty of the individual thinker, but the active, creative force of the world. Hegel hoped to demonstrate that when we think, we are not merely manipulating private ideas, but participating in the same logical activity that generates and structures all of reality. Thus, when the philosopher arrives methodologically at a concept such as quantity, it is not a category imposed by the subject upon an alien world. Rather, it is the same quantity that objectively structures a chair, for example, out in the world. The chair possesses quantity as an attribute contained within its own being; the principle of the object is not sourced from the subject but discovered in the object. Therefore, philosophical thought isn’t confronting a foreign world, or totality, it traces the totality’s own self-unfolding, including the object as it is separate from us, and the subject as it is us. Hegel names the result of what thought, as generative process, has produced, the Idea (Idee). It is important to realize that the proof that this process of thought is not just in your head, is in the pudding of Hegel’s work, but also in the fact that Hegel’s project can be explained as exploring what Steiner calls a “cosmic thought”. The contrast to the in-your-head thought has led me to describe it this way: there is a “local” function of thought, and a “global” function of thought. They are one and the same for Hegel (with the clarification that this unity only occurs once one comprehends logical thought, and also a point which will be contested, at the begrudging moan of my Hegelian friends by the end of this post). The endpoint of the process is the Absolute Idea: the moment when Spirit achieves complete self‑consummation in and through human consciousness. In terms of the system, the object, or the world, is not alien, but the Idea in its otherness. Correspondingly, the subject is not confined to the finite &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, it is also present within the object, since both are ultimately unified in an absolute subject-object identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brief note on recursivity&lt;/b&gt;: any true system of totality has a moment or recursion. I wish not to exhaust the topic here, because I am saving it for my “systematizing Steiner” project. The reason Spirit must find itself is, because in a system of totality, in a system that describes everything, the end must return to the beginning enriched by the entire journey. The recursive aspect is not a logical flaw, but the mark of something living. The circle is called “virtuously” circular because it is self-grounding, mediates immediacy, and embodies freedom (self-determination). The circle is the logical form of this- Spirit determines itself by returning to itself out of its own otherness (however, the philosopher does not understand that this circle is only the very shape of self-conscious freedom). Since this totality’s (Spirit) knowledge is essentially self-knowledge, it becomes actual only by realizing itself in and through its other. Spirit, to be actual, must go out of itself, give itself form in an other (nature, history, institutions), and then recognize itself in that other. If this remained purely implicit, it would be the worst form of empty abstraction. Hegel’s system shows Spirit giving birth to the Concept, which creates the objective world, supposedly, only to then recognize the world as its own expression. This journey from self-externality to self-recognition is the process of Spirit becoming real to itself. What does it say that this Absolute, God, is capable of creating beings which recognize the Absolute, such that this Absolute is itself constitutive of them? We will leave that for another day. For the biblically minded, the ask of recursion in philosophy, is similar to the ask of Christ in Matthew 18:3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is not saying to stay statically in an impressionable, child-like state. It is a call for a transformation of self-mediation from the mediation and lukewarm being of adulthood. For if it was truly a call to the former, the moment man becomes child, and child becomes man, the fall of man commences eternally. Not very optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s method beings his exploration of philosophy in what is dubbed “presuppositionlessness”. Rather than, at this point, &lt;em&gt;enjoying&lt;/em&gt; the pitfalls of other sciences, which take as given their object, one needs to keep in mind that the object of reason is itself. Since reason is turned in on itself, reason becomes both the instrument and the object of investigation. We can take this in comparison to Kant, who in his critical philosophy, needs a given, a presupposition, in order to &lt;em&gt;critique&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. To think without presupposition is to allow thought, or reason, to generate and examine its own foundations. Reason is being used to discover reason. This “self-reflexive” starting point unveils what Hegel identifies as the three moments inherent in an all genuine speculation (note: speculation here is meant in the sense of “sight”, as in spectacle, seeing as reason does, not speculation as in arbitrary conjecture): Understanding, Dialectical Reason, and Speculative Reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: the number 3 is important here, for the reason that it is the number of recursion, talked about briefly above. The significance lies in its role as the minimal structure for a self-mediating return. [(1)Understanding- (2)Dialectical Reason]- (3)Speculative Reason. This third moment is where the circle closes: the outcome reflects on the beginning, showing that the initial immediacy was always already mediated. The process is recursive because the end reconstitutes the beginning, as justified and comprehended. The reason it is not one (which I hesitate to term “monad” for the confusion it may cause) is because a single term would be static, it would be unable to account for itself, it’s genesis, or it’s truth/ideality. It would also lack an inferiority and self relation, and therefore lack freedom and life. The dyad (from affirmation to negation, let’s say) would end in cancellation, or an endless oscillation like skepticism. It lacks the moment of &lt;em&gt;upheaval&lt;/em&gt;, the moment whereby contradiction is resolved into a higher unity that preserves difference within itself. In Hegel’s system, the triadic rhythm is the logical form of self-consciousness and self-grounding. Spirit begins in immediacy, loses itself in otherness, and returns to itself as mediated unity. The recursive circle, where the end is the beginning made explicit, is what makes the system self-justifying and total. It doesn’t rely on external foundation, the legitimacy lies in itself. Thus, 3 is the number of recursion because it is the minimal structure for a movement that goes out from itself and returns to itself, having incorporated its own negation. It is the shape of a circle that is not empty repetition, but a spiral of development!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding (&lt;em&gt;Verstand&lt;/em&gt;) is thought in its fixing, isolating mode. It establishes clear, stable definitions and distinctions, treating each concept as independent and self-sufficient. The core operation of the Understanding is to assert that A = A and A != B. Things are defined by what they are not, universal concepts are produced by extracting a single property or set of properties from a concrete whole to create a universal, and it organizes the world into genera, species, types, laws, taxonomies, and plants. Bcause of this, the Understanding is indispensable for precision in science, law, character, and art, providing the fixity in the world. It is akin to the goodness of God, in creating determinate enduring things. However, what it does is treating these stabilized “concepts” as ultimate and self-sufficient realities, forgetting that they are abstract in the lowest sense of the word. Yet, if left alone, it renders reality static and dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dialectic Reason (negative Reason) is the self-negating movement inherent in those fixed determinations. Every finite concept, when thought through (or procedurally generated enough), reveals its own limit and internal contradiction, thereby passing over into it’s opposite. This is not an externally sourced critique, just an emphasis on the indwelling tendency of all things finite. The law that life contains the germ of death, that pride precedes a fall, the dynamic force of the object (nature, history, thought). When isolated, this moment becomes an endless oscillation, skepticism, which sees only negation, but in truth, this moment of negation is entirely necessary for progression. In this stage, the maxim of Spinoza: &lt;em&gt;omnis determinatio est negatio&lt;/em&gt; (every determination is negation) becomes explicit. Each fixed determination, when thought through, reveals that it’s very identity depends on excluding it’s other, and that this exclusion negates its claim to be self-sufficient. The finite shows itself to be finite only through its limitation, which is its negation. In the previous stage, this maxim was implicit and latent. Determinations operate in the Understanding as if they were purely affirmative, isolating each category and holding it static. Negation is an external limit (this is not that), and not yet grasped as internal to the concept itself. The Understanding implicitly relies on negation to define its boundaries, but does not think negation is essential to the thing’s own being. It can be said that meaning itself is negation, for what does it mean to mean, what does it mean to exist, than to stand out from the whole? In order to be something, it needs to stand in distinction to unity, otherwise it would not be intelligible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative Reason (positive Reason) is the unifying comprehension that follows negation. Or, if you want more Hegelian words; the site where both “sides” expel their negative coalesce and settle into a ground. The speculative moment is the moment whereby a concept (subject) and its opposite are seen as necessary moments within some higher concrete ideality, or truth. This result is positive because it contains and preserves what was negated. Spinoza’s maxim finds its final moment as it realizes that negation is also constitutive. Negation, which seemed to dissolve determination, is now seen as the very means by which Concept (subject) mediates itself with itself. Determination is negation, but negation is equally &lt;em&gt;position&lt;/em&gt;. The concrete unity (speculative unity) emerges by virtue of the negation of negation. What is truly determinate is not a static point, but a self‑determining whole that contains its own negation as a moment within itself. Thus, “all determination is negation” becomes “all negation is (self‑)determination”. Accordingly, Hegel’s method is not a tool applied to reality from outside; it is the form of reality’s own self-thinking. Beginning “presuppositionlessly” means allowing reason to generate and overcome its own determinations, or in other words, to trace, without external imposition, the Absolute’s unfolding from abstract immediacy to concrete self-knowledge. It is the logical embodiment of Spirit’s journey. The immanent genesis of the totality begins not with empirical facts or dogmatic axioms, but with the most minimal, self-evident thought one can think, or rather &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; think: pure indeterminate Being. This empty starting point is the Idea in it’s abstract immediacy. From this, the speculative method, the engine of the Concept, is set to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it does, until we arrive at the Concept. I will not rob you of the joy of struggling with Hegel until you “get it”, and chances are if you are reading this, you probably already do (either struggle, or get it, or have struggled to get it). What I mean to convey is that the development… develops, until we arrive at Concept. The concept is the active principle of self-determination through self-differentiation. Being the third section of the Science of Logic (the beginning of his system and exploration), the Concept naturally occupies the recursive position of self-mediation, mirroring the triadic rhythm present at every scale: immediacy, mediation, and self-mediation. It’s borderline enlightening when one grasps the echoes of reality with itself. The triad of the Logic (Being, Essence, Concept) resonates with the triad of the entire system (Logic, Nature, Spirit), and both, in turn, rhyme with the three moments of the speculative method (Understanding, Dialectical Reason, Speculative Reason). This is not mere repetition but a “recursive elaboration”, where each subsequent triad re-enacts the previous at a higher level of concreteness. For example, the nature of immediacy itself transforms as one advances. The immediacy with which the Logic begins in the Doctrine of Being, that pure, abstract presence, is fundamentally different from the immediacy encountered in the Doctrine of Essence. This is already a mediated immediacy, an appearance that presupposes an internal ground or reflection. This transformation demonstrates that immediacy, or being, is not a static starting point, but a living moment that is continuously reconstituted and enriched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telos of this process is the Absolute Idea. This is the point where Concept has fully externalized itself (as Nature), and returned to itself (as Spirit), now possessing self-knowledge. Spirit recognizes the entire odyssey, from Being to the complexity of civilization and its fruits, as its own activity. For Hegel, this realization is absolute freedom. Freedom isn’t an arbitrary choice one makes, it is self-determination in accordance with rational necessity. When the philosopher grasps the system, their thinking ceases to be a subjective reflection on the world, and becomes the very activity of Spirit thinking itself. This is the culmination, where the &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; subject and the object &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; (generative process) are to be understood as one and the same. The Absolute Idea is this self-consummation of the system. It is the beginning, which is the abstract Idea, or Logic as Idea as Subject, gone through mediation where Nature is the Idea as Object, and finally returns to itself through Nature, through the world and externality, recognizing the object as its own activity, and returns in the form of Spirit, or the Idea as Subject-Object. The concretely self-comprehending Idea having mediated itself through all of reality, forms a virtuous circle where the origin is justified by result, and the result is fully explicated by origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I comprehended a fragment of this, it felt as if a long chapter of my life had finally concluded. Not to mention the point where my good friend Antonio Wolf&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; walked me through the Science of Logic late at night, up until the point of Infinity, or the time I cried while reading the Lesser Logic due to the grandeur of existence, or the time I almost fell down the steps after being enchanted by Hegel’s writings on gravity in the Philosophy of Nature. The comprehension of the system heralded for his time a completion and the closure of the circle of Philosophy. Hegel brought the old form of philosophy, which wanted to comprehend the world through intellectual concepts alone, to its final unsurpassable conclusion. As we return to the initial topic of frameworks, genesis, and ideality, Hegel’s system can be said to be the framework of frameworks. It does not propose a partial perspective, but rather it proposes the self-comprehending totality that derives every possible category of though and form of reality, from a single self moving principle. Logically, it incorporates and situates every other finite standpoint before and after it in philosophy, as necessary, but subordinate moments within its own development. The closure it achieves by circling back by its own beginning demonstrates that its starting point was already the endpoint in implicit form, thus becoming the self-grounding system that accounts for the very real possibility of systematic knowledge itself. It is a framework, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; framework, that explains why there are frameworks, the narrative about why there are narratives, and the circle that knows itself as circle, to name a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a strange thing that Hegel’s teachings aren’t &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; new. His core thought, that the physical world, or object, is the externalization of what Steiner calls cosmic thought (thought in it’s global function, as generative process), as the solution to the chasm of subject and object left by Kant, is in essence, identical to the foundational doctrine of Western esotericism and occult secret societies. The world is created and sustained by thought- divine ideas, archetypes, spiritual beings. Hegel didn’t arrive at this through occult initiation, but through rigorous philosophical reasoning. It did not matter, for example, that his roommate Fichte was a Freemason, or other figures in his proximity such as Reinhold were the same. Through naively observing this truth in the structure of reality itself, and systematizing it in his logic, he grasped this doctrine. The content of his philosophy is esoteric wisdom, but his method was public, rational philosophy. Hegel himself comments on the esoteric/exoteric distinction in the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, stating that such a distinction does not exist in philosophy, since the only necessary thing is the necessity of the ideas. One cannot hold onto an entire idea as they do a physical item. Perhaps this is why there is a tragic poetic irony, or correlation, in both the fact that Hegel’s own works were published fairly late in his life, and the grand system contain in his works were destined to be understood only long after his time. This is not in accident of history, but a necessary consequence of the gap between Hegel’s conceptual world, and the ordinary consciousness of his time. Hegel’s philosophy demands a thinking that has developed to its highest power, a thinking that can live within the self movement of itself. Yet, most people, even to this day, remain within a simpler, more sensory-bound form of consciousness. Thus, the delay in comprehension isn’t to be explained as a scholarly lag. It’s testament to the spiritual/intellectual development required to meet Hegel’s thought. His system appeared as a shadowy image of spiritual reality, cast ahead of it’s time. Its late reception reflects the slow collective awakening of human thinking to the level where Concept can be recognized not as abstraction, but as living spirit. In this sense, the tragedy is also a promise. What arrives too early for its contemporaries, becomes the foundational challenge for the future. Just as Alfred North Whitehead claimed that all of philosophy is a footnote to Plato, all of modernity is a footnote to Hegel. Every subsequent thinker has to contend with what he has put forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-character-of-hegels-project"&gt;The Character of Hegel&amp;rsquo;s Project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of reading and understanding Hegel are numerous. Firstly, Hegel’s philosophy is the ultimate training room for thinking itself. Since the requirement is for a mind to move beyond the reliance of sense-perception, and to operate with absolute logical rigor and consistency within the realm of Idea, this strengthens one’s ability to think abstractly, independently, and, at times, creatively. Secondly, Hegel provides the most complete structure of reality and details how reality’s unfolding is possible in the first place. For example, understanding the relationship between the one and the many, the finite and the infinite, cause and effect. Familiarization with these categories goes hand in hand with the next point: to reach the peak (and limit) of philosophical thought. Hegel represents the path that the history of philosophy, and big questions in philosophy, have taken. Experiencing firsthand the culmination of this path is truly a transformative event. In learning how to think properly (such that it is one with the object, thought), your own thinking becomes transformed. You start to think speculatively. The final reason I will state, although not exhaustive, is that there is a liberation of Concept from being a dead abstraction. Hegel reveals Concept as living and moving. The empiricist, physicalist, or materialist views are undermined, and the mind is prepared to see thinking itself as a spiritual activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, it is with immense respect that one approaches the greatest thinker of the 19th century, regardless of intention. However, there is an interesting phenomenon where the awe Hegel’s system inspires itself becomes a kind of piety, where the admission of its greatness is mistaken for a demand for uncritical reverence. As Steiner observed, “some people can’t imagine that when something in contrast to them is great, humour can also be retained about it, because people imagine one must unconditionally show a long face when one confesses to experiencing something great in a well‑known person”. This dignity often shields Hegel from the very kind of immanent critique his own method requires. This being a critique that does not diminish his achievement, but takes it seriously enough to discover where the system, in its perfection, points beyond itself. For Steiner, that “beyond” isn’t, nor can it be, a negation of Hegel, but the transition from the abstract, logical Spirit (calm down Hegelians, let me make the argument first!), to the living active poietic reality we inhabit. The rigor provided by Hegel contributed to the hesitancy by which I confronted aspects of his system I felt were unconvincing. Aspects which gnawed on my subconscious until I could firstly, finally articulate what I did not agree with, and secondly, until I found an alternative in Steiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seed we begin with should be stated bluntly: Hegel’s cosmology was simply not convincing to me. The irony of this reason being unconvincing to the &lt;em&gt;reader&lt;/em&gt; is not lost on me. However, it’s the truth! The more I mastered Hegel’s system, the more I gained an almost visceral dissatisfaction. Spirit for Hegel is abstractly lord. Meaning, there is a non-contestable power to its claim, but unless once submerges themselves in philosophy, this itself is not convincing in Spirit. Additionally, you are free to align with God, with Spirit, and in fact are built in a way such that being and goodness align, and certainly, it is good to align yourself correctly. But where is the elaboration on the work of Spirit beyond individual humans and sociocultural formations? This absence is because such a description lies beyond what Hegel aims to do, and what he can justify. His concern is the logical movement of Spirit toward self-conscious freedom, not the descriptive hierarchy of spiritual beings. And as a result, the cosmology is left feeling very flat. Because Hegel’s methodology has no place in the dialectic for the concrete life of higher and lower spirits, no place for beings who cultivate themselves and sacrifice their substance out of love to create the world. Such a living cosmology cannot be deduced from Concept alone; it requires a methodology of direct spiritual perception, the very approach Rudolf Steiner develops. Only this allows for a freedom more concrete than Hegel’s logical self-return. A freedom that participates in the creative sacrifice of spiritual beings. Who among us, after all, has a reverence for the lower orders of form, of the stones, plants, and animals, because we recognize they are the borrowed vessels through which higher spirits fashion bodies? Hegel surely doesn’t, stating that nothing in Nature is as worthy of veneration as human art. The person who has this reverence can truly be called a teacher, one we can all learn from. Hegel’s Spirit unfolds conceptually; Steiner’s Spirit lives, loves, and creates (resisting the urge to say life, laugh, love, especially in the context of all the white American suburban women who have found themselves drawn to the works of Steiner, of which Steiner himself predicted, funny enough). This difference is not one of degree, but one of kind. No, that it was not convincing to me is not convincing to you, but it did lead me to precisely outline and submerge myself in Hegel, in order to find out why he was unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s project seeks to be immanently generative, deriving all reality, from the self-movement of thought. Because its generativity is purely logical, it unfolds only what is already implicit in the starting point, and as such it is the logical explication of a closed system, not an open, creative act that produces genuine novelty. The outcome of this logical generativity is a supremely coherent, self-enclosed map of spiritual reality. Further, the very perfection of the map, Hegel’s system, its seamless logical closure, is precisely what reveals it &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a map, and not territory. A living territory would possess an inherent openness, a receptivity to the novel and genuinely new. The Hegelian will object here and say that the system’s ceaseless self-negation &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; its openness. However, this movement is internal to the circuit of thought itself; it is the recursive unfolding of what was already logically enfolded in the starting principle. This “openness” is the motion of a closed circle, it is the closed circuit of thought&amp;rsquo;s own generation. A magnificent, self-generating logical process, for sure, but one that cannot receive anything from outside its own generative rules. This is not an argument against circularity or recursion as such, as I previously emphasized the need for such a thing, it is an argument about the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of circle. Hegel’s is a circle of thought, thinking itself. Contrast this with the method of a Goethe, whose thinking enters into a receptive dialogical relationship with the phenomenon, allowing the thing itself to reveal its law and spiritual, or ideal, being on its own terms and not on the terms of Concept. What you find is that the former is a closed circuit of deduction, and the latter is an open engagement with being. Hegel’s perfection is that of the completed blueprint, not the perfection of the living world. The system is the shadowy image, as Steiner says, or the logical blueprint of the world’s becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the exact nature of Hegel’s system further, we can employ a metaphor Steiner offers: the relation of a shadow to the hand that casts it. Hegel’s philosophy is like a perfect, logical shadow. It’s coherent, definitely, but it is a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional living thing (this thing being Spirit). The living reality, which is Spirit, creative activity, is the hand. Hegel’s genius lies in deducing its every necessary shape, and connection. The foundational error made here is mistaking the shadow for substance. He devoted himself to the silhouette, believing it to be the source, rather than recognizing it as a derivative image of a prior living form. The philosopher then really works in a magical circle, drawn by this play of shadows, unable to turn and perceive the hand whose movement casts it. This metaphor clarifies the model Steiner suggests. The network of concepts forms a kind of boundary (he uses the word tablet) between sensible perception and the higher supersensible reality, placing Concept, or philosophy, as a kind of mediating term between sensible reality and the supersensible (through higher faculties). And so Hegel’s Concept and Idea aren’t descriptions of totality, they are mediating interfaces of it. In fact, this is the reason purely mental constructs like geometric circles, or algebraic equations, describe the physical world with an almost frightening precision (to the extent that the less enlightened among us say that the language of the universe is numbers). The correspondence itself is proof that the conceptual network constitutes the structural interface (tablet, aka Concept/Idea) between Spirit and Nature, or between the Idea as Other, and the Idea as finally returned. We don’t derive the concept of a circle from sensory experience, like observing a horizon. We generate it inwardly, and then a profound moment occurs where we discover that this inwardly generated form governs external reality. This shows the conceptual order isn’t abstracted from sensation, but is the formal boundary condition that makes coherent sensation possible in the first place. Hegel’s system is an exhaustive logical exposition of this interface. The power comes from describing the structural rules of the mediating boundary itself, the logic of the “tablet” (this is Concept). And so this is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; why it can seem to explain everything! It’s articulating the rules of the game board. The effectiveness of its deductions mirrors the effectiveness of mathematics. There is a reflection of the formal ordering principles at work in manifestation, but here is a very important point: this never reaches the source of the game, to the players, or to the act of playing. Math can describe an orbit, but it can never tell you why a planet exists, why it moves, and so on and so forth. Likewise, Hegel’s logic can deduce the necessary relations of thought, but it cannot generate the qualitative fact of a planet’s existence/being, or the living impulse behind its motion. The map is flawless precisely because it abstracts from the living territory to its formal relation. Thus, what Steiner calls the “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics” (and by extension, Hegel&amp;rsquo;s logic) doesn&amp;rsquo;t prove that reality’s highest point is the Hegelian Idea. It proves that Concept is the necessary lens through which a created, intelligible world becomes comprehensible to the mind and thought. Hegel described the lens with unparalleled rigor, then concluded the lens was the eye, the light, and the visible world all at once. This is partly why Hegel’s Spirit feels abstract and flat to me. When one studies only the shadow which is created by the hand, one misses the warmth, pulse, and purposeful movement, or telos, of the hand. Correspondingly, Hegel’s Spirit is Spirit as logical function, or completed syllogism, not itself the living community of creative, loving beings (not just humans), who actively cultivate and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Blake&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Newton&lt;/em&gt; addresses a thinker so fixated on measuring reality&amp;rsquo;s blueprint, that he misses it&amp;rsquo;s living source and subsequently, the truth of reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us address the accusation of abstract, because it is meant in two senses. The first sense is the previously mentioned logicism, which will be elaborated on later. The second sense is in the fact that Spirit, for Hegel, remains &lt;em&gt;in potentia&lt;/em&gt; until it is concretized by man, as opposed to Steiner where Spirit is very concrete as the hierarchies of spiritual beings. Here you see the seeds of the Promethean humanism that would be developed by Marx: the elevation of human consciousness to the role of necessary “actualizer” of the Absolute, implicitly via labor. In other words, the system is not a map, it is a map which reproduces its own methodological bias in every result. Having begun with logic, it can only ever find logic; having excluded any receptive relation to a reality beyond thought, it can only ever return to itself. What presents itself as reality’s self-unveiling is unveiled to be the self-unveiling of Hegel’s logical apparatus. For now, it may be helpful to imagine the distinction between Hegel, and what a post-Hegelian system needs to accomplish, as the difference between the map and the territory. While Hegel is detailing a perfect map, it is not the same as being in the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In that Empire, the craft of Cartography attained such Perfection that the Map of a Single province covered the space of an entire City, and the Map of the Empire itself an entire Province. In the course of Time, these Extensive Maps were found somehow wanting, and so the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was of the same Scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point for point. Less attentive to the Study of Cartography, Succeeding Generations came to judge a map of such Magnitude cumbersome, and, not without Irreverence, they abandoned it to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;—Jorge Luis Borges, &amp;ldquo;On Exactitude in Science&amp;rdquo; (1946)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-of-contingency"&gt;The Problem of Contingency
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The map’s perfection reveals its categorical limitations when held against the territory, or living reality. The first, and most telling, limitation is what I call the “Problem of Contingency”. Hegel’s system positions itself as the necessary capstone of philosophy’s history, yet it cannot explain why &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; necessary truth manifested in the early 19th century. It itself is a product of a spiritual and historical development that it did not, and logically &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt;, immanently generate, only retrospectively justify. The system describes necessity, but its own existence is a contingent fact that escapes the method. Likewise, the Hegelian response is to exclaim that the contingent is necessary in actuality, that the historical appearance is some or other necessary actualization of Spirit at a specific stage. Philosophy is its own time apprehended in thoughts, according to Hegel, and so the system is not a timeless truth descending from nowhere, but the &lt;em&gt;conceptual articulation&lt;/em&gt; of the historical substance of its era. The “why now” is answered by the Encyclopedic system, such that the publication of Hegel’s system is not a contingent event on the timeline of spirit, but itself the timeline of Spirit achieving self-recognition. Ultimately, this is a confusion of explanation with after-the-fact justification. The Hegelian response provides a brilliant &lt;em&gt;retrospective rationalization&lt;/em&gt; but not a &lt;em&gt;generative explanation&lt;/em&gt;. It can assign the event a necessary place in the logical narrative after the fact, but cannot derive the unique qualitative reality of 1817 Berlin from being. This is, in effect, a performative contradiction: the system, in explaining everything, cannot account for its own existence as a lived creative act. It can only incorporate it as a logical moment, stripping it of its vital truth. In addition to this, Hegel’s history of philosophy portrays itself as a vicious hermeneutic circle, stating that “the system appeared when it did because history had reached the stage the system describes”. This functions as an immunity against the genuine question of its own historical genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concrete example of this problem was brought to my attention, firstly by me. I was struggling with another problem I dubbed, the &amp;ldquo;Socrates and Buddha&amp;rdquo; problem, wherein I was trying to reconcile something in Hegel but found the solution in Steiner. What I was trying to understand was why &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; individuals become world-historical vessels. For example, why Socrates, and why Buddha? On one level, their historical emergence seems almost contingent, depending on fragile transmissions from particular disciples. Yet their archetypal roles are necessary: Socrates embodies rational self-examination, looking outward, and Buddha, universal compassion and inner liberation. Inner and outer. The Hegelian answer is once again to say that the necessity works through contingency. Abstractly, and logically, this is the case. The essential truth of their teachings prevails despite historical accidents. But this remains a logical abstraction, a retrospective justification, not an explanation. Hegel’s grand “cunning of reason” is essentially a logical placeholder. Found within Steiner is an elaboration of the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; turning into the metaphysics of Spirit’s agency. What Hegel calls World-Spirit, Steiner describes as spiritual hierarchies working through karmic agreements, and pre-earthly soul choices. The individual, in this case Socrates, Buddha, or a disciple, is not a passive node but a free collaborator. The soul chooses its path and conditions before incarnation; with inspiration requiring a receptive human vessel. Even the possessing of Spirit by man demands the individual’s consent. Steiner preserves Hegel’s insight, that necessity works through contingency, while grounding it in concrete processes and freedom. Suffering is not flattened into a logical node. The world we live in hears cries of anguish to God, the heavens, or anyone listening and receives this suffering as a substantive event, not as a mere contingency. Pain, pleasure, love, regret, insight, “eureka” moments, and more, are all felt by the whole. By subordinating all contingency into logical necessity, the Hegelian response collapses the living process of spiritual creation into a pre-determined script. In Steiner’s terms, it replaces the creative, sometimes improvisational, work of spiritual beings (the hierarchies) with an impersonal, logical automation. The “why” of Socrates or Hegel is reduced to a nodal point in a syllogism, not understood as the result of concrete spiritual guidance, karmic trajectories, and free spiritual agency working through historical contingencies. The Hegelian response thus embodies the very “flatness” of Spirit my initial intuition-turned-critique identifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time this was brought to my intention was when a friend introduced an alternative viewpoint: what if the History of Philosophy is actually the capstone of Hegel’s project? In hearing his explanation, it made sense, and I quickly and intuitively responded with the fact that this sounds like something Steiner’s project hopes to aim. After a day of thinking and talking about it, I agreed with him. He proposed that the History of Philosophy is the true capstone of the system, not just in subject, but in its reality since it “describes and enacts”. History, in this view, is the singular “description-enaction” where thought, and it’s object become one. Initially, this struck me as profound, and akin to what Steiner’s spiritual science aims at. This being a living unity of knowledge and reality. After a day, I disagreed once more, recognizing a subtle but decisive limitation. Even in this reading, the practical summons that emerges from Hegel’s history (the call to enact freedom consciously) remains a logical consequence of achieved Absolute Knowledge. It’s still, ultimately, a movement within philosophical comprehension. Thus, while the system can culminate in a transformative insight that bridges theory and practice, this transition itself is still comprehended and derived from the standpoint of completed philosophy. The “capstone” is therefore not an open, creative entry into history, but the final consummate description that logically necessitates a new form of practice. This is what preserves Hegel’s circle; that the end of theoretical history yields a practical imperative, yet both remain moments within the self-enclosed speculation of the Idea. The problem of contingency remains, although it might be a bit misinformed to call it a problem, since it’s more the &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of something the system can provide. And to fair, Hegel’s project is expressly aimed in solving philosophy, nothing more. The naming of it as a problem is moreso a politic move in order to urge Hegelians to see beyond, within the narrative of my own journey. Besides, even if the problem of contingency were resolved, a more fundamental limitation remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-of-qualitative-immediacy"&gt;The Problem of Qualitative Immediacy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Hegel’s system stumbles on historical contingency, then it faces a bigger problem when confronted with the raw being of the world, and the unmediated quality of living perception, which is something the logic cannot produce or capture. I will say it again: the logical method CANNOT generate or account for the qualitative immediacy, the raw, sensuous, &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, of living experience. The system must treat the shock of color, the pang of grief, or the awe before a work like Moby-Dick, as mere logical predicates, moments in the self-determination of the Concept. Yet this formalism reaches its crisis not with sense-perception at the “bottom”, but with the very peak of spiritual concreteness: the encounter with a person. For Hegel, all individuality is conceptually mediated. A person is an individuality &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt;. The system provides room for Christ as the necessary conceptual principle of God-man unity, as well as the Individual Individuality found within the structure of Universal, Particular, and Individual. Unfortunately, this Christ-principle is not the sensuous living person encountered in prayer or revelation. The immediacy of a &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is always already reduced to a logically mediated &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;. The system may be able to generate the Idea of Christ, but it cannot host the encounter. Thus, in its treatment of its own most supremely concrete individual, the system points implicitly to a domain beyond its formal grasp: the domain of non-Conceptually mediated personal being. This is not a failure of Hegel’s Christianity as much as it is a necessary result of the formalism of the Concept. If logic can’t hold the living Christ, what is it to hold? Only his shadow. The formalism described here in full clarity is that since all objects are apprehended in and through their logical relation as necessary, universal, and mediated by Concept, Concept’s organization and giving intelligibility to content (hence &lt;em&gt;shaping&lt;/em&gt; the object) is a formalism. Concept only encounters objects as structured and generated by itself. This is what we might call the formalism of the Concept. Everything must be translated into the currency of logical relations. As a result, the system is structurally blind to the very datum of consciousness, which is the very real, almost startling, given presence of sensation and feeling. This is a point-blank categorical exclusion demanded by Hegel’s sovereign, generative thinking. The map is drawn entirely in the ink of mediation; it has no symbols for the immediate, being of reality. Therefore, it can describe the logical necessity of sense-certainty as a failed form of consciousness, but it can’t originate the sensation itself. This explanatory deficit reveals that thinking’s sovereignty is bought at the price of excluding the most intimate layer of being. The problems of contingency and quality converge to reveal the final lack: life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The sophisticated Hegelian here might offer a rebuttal, “Life isn’t missing from the system! It appears &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; in the Science of Logic as a deduced category of the Idea, the moment where the Concept begins to grasp itself as a self-organizing totality”. For Hegel, this logical category is the truth and essence of life. However, this very defense proves the critique. Hegel provides the concept of life, its logical schema, but not the living reality itself. This is the ultimate expression of the map-territory divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-convergent-failure-of-both-problems"&gt;The Convergent Failure of Both Problems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us re-establish what Hegel’s project is, in light of this. It is the exposition of the Word, that flawless logical blueprint, the Logos as the complete ratio and relational grammar of the universe. After all, the entire Science of Logic can be read as an onto-logical proof of God. This is the God before creation. Hegel’s system is this divine logic, self-contained, and self-justifying in all its grandeur. Given this, Goethe’s final lines in Faust Part II, &lt;em&gt;Chorus Mysticus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, points to what the logical Word cannot accomplish on its own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that is transient
&lt;br&gt;Is but a parable;
&lt;br&gt;What is inadequate,
&lt;br&gt;Here becomes an event;
&lt;br&gt;The indescribable
&lt;br&gt;Here is accomplished;
&lt;br&gt;The eternal feminine
&lt;br&gt;Pulls us upwards&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;—Goethe, &amp;ldquo;Chorus Mysticus&amp;rdquo;, Faust Part 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lines conclude the entire Faust drama, spoken by a mystical chorus. Hegel, the philosopher, sees the world of becoming. He sees birth, growth, decay, death, and he correctly interprets it. He sees that these fleeting moments that are coming to be and ceasing to be are not the ultimate reality, they point to a higher ideality. All that is transient, is but a parable indeed, one that Hegel has deciphered, showing how every finite thing is a moment in the self-unfolding of the infinite Idea. In this, Goethe and Hegel are indeed fellow travelers. However, the inadequate becoming an event is a stage which philosophical logic cannot achieve. It is the moment of realization and incarnation, where Hegel by his own standard, or method, must cease. Because he must cease here, the “event to be done” is Spirit’s historical unfolding, grasped retrospectively by philosophy. Above all, as the famous saying goes, the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk. For Goethe, the conceptual blueprint, no matter how magnificent, is inadequate. It lacks the power to become an “event to be done”. Hegel’s system is not wrong about life per se, it simply offers life as a specter. It is a chronicle of past reconciliations written in the dried out ink of logic, as opposed to an encounter with the present, living creative act. Its very completeness is its sterility, and what results in what we identify as the fetishism at the heart of the system. Hegel sought Spirit &lt;em&gt;in thought&lt;/em&gt; and found it there. His intention was quite noble and very profound. The intention was to transcend the human subject in thought and align its consciousness with the objective, creative World-Spirit. Yet, in an ironic reversal, he did not use logic as a medium to connect with living Spirit, instead he surrendered himself to the logical Idea, making the completed system (Absolute Idea) the ultimate object of his devotion. As Steiner argues, he committed a “fetishism of logic”. He correctly discovered Spirit within human thinking, but then made the categorical error of believing “that this spirit of human thinking, when developed to its highest power, is the World-Spirit” (GA 108)&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, he surrendered to the pinnacle of ideation, not to the ideal creative source that produces the very capacity for ideation. The living generative reality of Spirit was replaced in his system by the worship of its own flawless shadow. The tool is the idol. Hence, the system becomes a monument to its own methodological triumph, a self-enclosed sanctuary where Logic is the supreme activity of God. That living, suffering, sacrificing, creative reality of Spirit, the very same Spirit Hegel claimed to unveil, retreats into the inaccessible beyond, visible only as a silhouette cast upon walls. The philosopher, being left in a temple of sublime shadows, mistakes the play of forms for the presence of divinity. Hegel’s philosophy articulates the perfect, living plan of the world, but it still remains a plan. It is the Word that has not yet spoken itself into flesh, the ratio that has not yet suffered the risk of incarnation. This ultimately is the chasm between the map and the territory. Hegel gives us Logos in logical purity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ambassadors (1533), Hans Holbein the Younger&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Holbein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Ambassadors&lt;/em&gt; represents a world of perfectly mastered symbols (notice the tools of measurement). Yet at its feet lies a distorted skull, or the undenaible reality of death: an unassimilable contigency, and the immediacy of &lt;em&gt;memento mori&lt;/em&gt;. Death may be the most intense, and of course most easily accessible, non-negotiable instance of qualitative immediacy. Every person needs to contend with their own mortality. Even so, it can only be seen &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; by shifting one&amp;rsquo;s perspective away from the brilliant surface of the map. So too must we view Hegel’s logical construction to grasp the living Spirit it occludes. Hegel famously critiqued the phrase “Spirit is a bone” in the Phenomenology of Spirit as the error of misplaced concreteness, the dead end of finding Spirit in the world. Ironically, he did not escape crafting it&amp;rsquo;s logical twin: “Idea [here meant as generated reality] is a syllogism&amp;quot;. It&amp;rsquo;s a great irony that this skull represents that very same critique as self-applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is a constitutive, ethical-aesthetic blindness. Because the system cannot host a genuine encounter, it fails before the very realities it seeks to spiritualize. It can rationally reconstruct Melville’s posthumous recognition, but it cannot feel the weight of his obscurity or recognize the divine inspiration (and trust me, Moby Dick was divinely inspired) as a living current. The tragic particularity of suffering and the surplus of meaning in genius become logical nodes in a syllogism, never events to be lived. I think it is fair to call this a limitation, at this point. The limitation reveals its own imperative. If the perfect blueprint feels lifeless, and if the flawless logic cannot account for its own genesis in history, or its failure before a crying heart, then the task isn’t to refine the blueprint. It’s to seek a builder, or in clearer terms, shift from the kind of reflective contemplation philosophy provides, to developing a more active capacity to eventually participate in the living activity that enacts philosophy. That living activity of Spirit which labors, sacrifices, and loves that blueprint into existence is what we seek. Fundamentally, this is what I think is clarified by the Steinerian turn. From the closed circle of thought thinking itself, to the open development of capacities that allows consciousness to interface with the beings who think the world into being. This marks the passage from the philosophy of the Concept, to the science of the Spirit that utters it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="steinerian-turn"&gt;Steinerian turn&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Steinerian turn”, so to say, is deeply informed by Goethe’s revolutionary method, which exchanges the spectator stance or pseudo-Archimedean point of thinkers like Darwin, for an active, imaginative “slipping into” organisms, or beings. Where Hegel’s retrospective method can only logically reconstruct the concept of life, Goethe’s practice of inwardly tracing the metamorphic gestures of a plant in &lt;em&gt;Metamorphosis of Plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and so &lt;em&gt;experiencing&lt;/em&gt; a formal law of expansion and contraction, begins to reunite the knower with a generative force (the generative force of that particular being), which is in actuality &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; generative force. Steiner radicalized this into a conscious spiritual science, where through disciplined inner activity, the observer transcends representational thinking to experience, not just in deducing, the spiritual reality actively shaping the phenomenal world. There is much to be said about the moment of recursion that Steiner pioneers in Goethe’s approach. Nevertheless, for now, I will refer only back to the section on the importance of recursion in a system of totality. Steiner’s continuation of Goethe here fulfills the imperative to move from Hegel’s perfect “map” as Concept, to the living territory of creative Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unacknowledged reader tagging along this blog post: the committed Hegelian. After me “totally obliterating Hegel” and proving he’s crazy and nonsensical and such, I would like to preview a few responses I’ve received from Hegelians, and where they go wrong. The dynamic between us, as interlocutors, is defined by a conflict of totalities. The “Hegelian”, let’s say, is claiming totality, just as the “Steinerian” (or any person whose system accurately captures the “beyond” of Hegel’s system) is. The situation is quite similar to the very beginning of this article, where claims to the totality of the object are made. Practically we can demonstrate the result: when confronted with a being, a &lt;em&gt;spiritual&lt;/em&gt; being, such as an Angel, the Hegelian will interpret it as a &lt;em&gt;Vorstellung&lt;/em&gt; (representation) that must be subordinated by the Concept. From this vantage, the Steinerian appears to be stuck in picture-thinking, mistaking an immediate mystical representation for true ideality, which for Hegel resides solely in the mediated movement of the Concept itself. After all, the true mysticism, claims Hegel, is in speculative thinking. Mysticism for him is a product of the Understanding. This isn’t a dismissal of the Steinerian, if I were to steel man this position. It is a correction, it is counsel to go further and meet the Concept. This is a profound reduction of the Steinerian standpoint. When the Steinerian says the Angel &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Idea, the Idea is meant in the same sense as Hegel, but as something more concrete than Hegel’s Conceptual Idea. It refers to active, intelligent beings who are architects of spiritual realities and can be perceived beyond ordinary sense-experience. The conflict is surely amplified by a shared vocabulary that masks divergent realities. Here is another example: When Beinsa Douno writes that he spoke to the Slavic folk-spirit, the Hegelian comprehends this as a conceptual grasp of historical and logical necessity, such that a concrete figure (man) represents the soul of the Slavic people. The Steinerian says: no, he talked with an actual &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, a spiritual person. He engaged in a participatory acquaintance with a conscious, guiding intelligence that was not a human. One of these standpoints is a knowledge about, reducing the thing to a representative of the thing (which is quite Kantian), and the other is knowledge of the thing-in-itself directly, by acquaintance. The highest practical example (that is to say, an example in practice) can be found by reading what Hegel says about the plant and what is logically entailed by it. Once this is finished, the &lt;em&gt;Metamorphosis of Plants&lt;/em&gt; by Goethe provides a stunning parallel (although it is not entirely correspondent to Steiner’s project, it is in the same Spirit of what a project of post-Hegelian totality looks like). In one text, a kind of categorization is going on, and in the other, the subject is fully participating in the being of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue being faced thus far is on language. Shared languages creates an illusion of common object, suggesting either a need for proprietary terms to dispel this conflation, or perhaps the strategic use of Hegel’s own language to reveal where his system points faithfully beyond itself. As of now, I am currently leaning towards the latter. This impasse resembles the reactions to the Ontological Argument. One either grasps it as a self-evident truism, or misunderstands and places that misunderstanding on part of the OA itself. The limit is not logical, but of the possibility of the subject’s being itself, and so it suggests to me that the ultimate resolution might not be argumentative, but transformative. Requiring a direct spiritual encounter- be it with an angel or Christ or by being instigated by psychadelics- that irrevocably shatters Hegelian Orthodoxy in a way that it cannot conceptually absorb. When put that way, it sounds almost threatening, that the solution is forced initiation, because that is what initiation is, a staged or controlled revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map is complete, with the relation between the map and the territory being that the map is the territory’s logically concluded past. A new domain is necessary to enter this territory as an ongoing creative future. Anthroposophy (Steiner’s system) seeks to enter this territory with the subject as an active collaborator within the Absolute. In light of this, allow me to borrow a metaphor from the earliest part of this article. The great anatomist of frameworks, Northrop Frye, sought a method for immanent genesis, one derived from the total structure of literature, and achieved it. By the same token, Hegel achieved this reality for itself, having sought an immanent genesis of the totality of totalities. Truly, there is no better comparison. Hegel himself is the ultimate critic, having given an immanent criticism of all there can be criticized. His system is the complete and perfect review of the “cosmic text”. Consider a work of immense complexity. A tapestry of history and references. The masterful critic can unveil its architecture. Perhaps he or she can explain how this or that detail relates to the whole, or how the prose supports the ethos of such and such part. The critical act is one of profound recovery and understanding. Yet for all its brilliance, the hermeneutic remains retrospective. The critic can reconstruct the logic of the fall of man in the Bible, but the critic did not cause the plummet. The critic can explain the symbol, but is not enduring the lived reality from which it exists, such that it is conveyed in the form firstly encountered in the text. The genius of criticism is to comprehend a world already made, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in making the world anew, nor in creation in general. Steiner’s project, therefore, is not to be a better critic, but to become a potential author, and train you to become one as well. The change lies in the move from perfecting interpretation to developing the faculties to participate in the “writing” (as a matter of metaphor, of course). Enough has been done to analyze the divine logic, but not enough has been done to collaborate with the divine &lt;em&gt;author&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In laying out the nature of truth, being, and the general arc of my narrative, there are bound to be accusations levied at me from a Hegelian flavoring. The first is a common one. It asserts that Steiner’s quest for real-time, participatory knowledge fails to grasp that retrospective comprehension is not a philosophical limitation, but the very form in which Truth actualizes itself, and that what he calls a “higher” activity is already the immanent, self-unfolding work of Concept. This is correct, however what is not grasped is that anthroposophy, as explained above, addresses a different activity altogether. Steiner fully acknowledges that retrospection is the mode of philosophical comprehension. His critique is that this mode is passive in relation to the creative act. The Concept’s “self-unfolding work” in this case is logically reconstructed after the fact by the philosopher. There is a necessary addition found in the capacity to co-participate in the unfolding as it occurs, such that Concept is not actually constitutive of that self-unfolding work. In other words, retrospective comprehension is the form of Truth-as-Known, but anthroposophy aims at Truth-as-Lived-Creation. The former is certainly necessary, but insufficient for the consciousness that seeks not just to understand Spirit, but to work with and within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sidenote&lt;/b&gt;: It is almost inevitable that the philosophically minded (meant as an insult) will hear the words “reflection” or “reflective act” and construct a straw man to attack as if I am operating with the premature logic of Essence that Hegel dispenses with by the time the system develops to the Concept. The individual capable of laying out the whole path of Hegel’s philosophy; one capable of understanding the distinction between Essence and Concept, is surely someone with enough expertise to not make such a blunder in thought. Certainly I am no expert, but absolutely not a novice. It reminds me of that one tweet that goes, “Little Caesars tastes so good when you don’t have a b&amp;mdash;- in your ear telling you it’s nasty”, only it’s to the tune of “Talking with people feels so good when you don’t have people intentionally misinterpreting you”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another accusation is in the same form as the previous, that the thinker is somehow misguided and not accounting for how the Concept already subsumes what one is saying. “Is Steiner not simply mistaking the acquisition of new perceptual content (or spiritual data) for the development of an entirely new faculty, when from a Hegelian standpoint any new immediacy is merely fresh material for the one sovereign faculty of thinking and Reason to mediate and comprehend”? This may sound devastating, and it is. For the Hegelian. For the Steinerian, the claim that “any new material is fresh material for thinking” proves his or her point! It confines all experience within the &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; of reflective thought. Steiner insists that spiritual perception is not just new content, but a qualitatively different relationship to reality, where the perceiver does not stand over and against an object, but consciously lives within the being of that object. The faculty is new because it overcomes the subject-object distinction inherent in sense-perception and logical reflection (and if the position is held that Hegel also overcomes the subject-object divide in philosophy, then at least it overcomes it in a way previously not standardized before). It is a participatory knowing, not an observational thinking. To call this “new material” is to reduce an active to a passive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final accusation is a rather dogmatic retort. It comes in the form of the assertion that in the encounter of spiritual reality, take Christ for example, the Hegelian will assert that the reality experienced of a Christ encounter, is &lt;em&gt;entirely negotiable&lt;/em&gt; with the Concept, or Hegelian Idea. This groundless response is the last refuge for someone who truly does not understand what is at stake. Not only was this position dealt with in the “The Problem of Qualitative Immediacy”, it is not honest. The full, honest, position is that super-sensible reality, such as Christ encounters, are either mistaken contingencies or merely the raw material for the Concept’s self-unfolding. Imagine telling someone who has had a Christ encounter that they did not meet a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, but a logical predicate in the dialectic of the Absolute. They would rightly respond: “I didn’t experience a ‘Concept’, I experienced Christ!”. The Hegelian, committed to translating this encounter upward into the self-mediation of Reason, is thereby committed to alienating the very person whose experience they claim to comprehend. Keep in mind, this is not a vindication of anti-intellectualism, or an appeal to colloquial understandings, but a clear signal that the disconnect between the systematic “knower” and the so-called simple believer reveals either a fundamental disagreement about the object itself or a total failure of translation. Both of which, exhibit an ineptitude that should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hegel-is-a-kantian"&gt;Hegel is a Kantian?!?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the “outrageous” claim that Hegel is a Kantian, it is not my intention to re-inscribe the problems of Kant’s era in calling Hegel a Kantian. He is not Kantian in his conclusions, but in his philosophical gesture. Hegel establishes the absolute sovereignty and constitutive power of thinkability. He completes Kant’s project by collapsing the noumenal/phenomenal divide, but only by making the thinkable (Concept) synonymous with the real. For Kant, the categories of understanding structure our knowledge of phenomena, leaving the thing-in-itself beyond reach. For Hegel, the categories of thought generate the very structure of being itself, and so there is no beyond for thought. However, this triumph comes at a cost identified by the critiques above. The system is a perfectly closed system of thinkable reality, a logical phenomenology. In this, he remains within Kant’s formal constraint; he equates reality with what can be grasped by the (now cosmic, as Steiner calls it) subject’s apparatus, or the global function of thought. This cannot account for the living, creative territory of spiritual beings that precede and exceed, but are still in part constituted by, logical representation. Hegel, in trying to contend with Kantianism, has produced the Absolute Idea, which is just as much a phenomenon contingent on noumena, as Kant’s thing-in-itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end on a high note, a salient point to emphasize is that Steiner does not negate Hegel, but seeks to fulfill him. Their projects share a common origin in the rupture diagnosed by Kant, and a common goal in the realization of human freedom. Both thinkers operate within surprisingly triadic movements: immediacy, mediation, and self mediation. This is the recursive rhythm of life and spirit. For Hegel, this logic culminates in the self-determination of the Absolute Idea. For Steiner, this same logic demands the actual practice of freedom, the development of faculties that allows man to participate consciously in the spiritual being that weaves the world. This is a shared Kantian inheritance. The difference is that Anthroposophy is a call to make the Hegelian system’s conclusion into a starting point. In turning the perfect map of Spirit’s past into a toolkit for navigating the living, creative future, we don’t merely comprehend freedom, but actively achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think this is a prime example of the devil&amp;rsquo;s chickens coming back home to roost. That the chickens that he sent out, the violence that he’s perpetuated&amp;hellip;I think this same violence has come back to claim one of their own.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;—Malcolm X, in response to the assassination of JFK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “shithole country” has entered popular political lexicon due, none other, than to our commander in chief, Donald Trump. The phrase conjures images to mind of endemic corruption and violence, and signals a failure of institutions. The unsaid implication here is one of &lt;em&gt;inherent&lt;/em&gt; inferiority, that there exists some kind of cultural rot which is native to the soil and to the people in question. As such, the response from the West is a mix of contempt, a doubling down on the abstract claim of determinate borders, and perhaps forms of patronizing charity (which at times are mechanisms used for ulterior motives). What you find missing from this series of responses, is a moment of self-reflection. There is a &lt;em&gt;refusal&lt;/em&gt; to ask the fairly obvious question: what made these countries “shitholes” in the first place? The uncomfortable truth that our politics cannot admit, is that the disorder we project onto the world is a reflection, and a direct consequence, of a logic that has now completed its long arc and settled in our very homes. The poverty of the “Global South” and the spiritual poverty (soon to be financial, no doubt) of America are not separate crises. They are symptoms of the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this is not to deny an element of individual responsibility within nations, nor to claim history is a force without individual agents. But such responsibility exists within a field of possibility that is not of the individual’s own making. Nor does it override the historical fact of &lt;em&gt;deliberate&lt;/em&gt;, external projects of intrusion on the self-determination of individuals, that same individual responsibility touted as the cause of a given “shithole’s” situation. In fact, what this position reveals goes beyond the mere inadequacy of abstract universalism (what is meant here is seeing the truth of individual responsibility as a hammer, and all other problems as nails). The position is in actuality a political choice that serves a specific function of the very same problem we will soon discuss. In its utterance, two things are accomplished. The first is the inversion of the burden of analysis. It tasks as given the universal “subject”, as opposed to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; subject in the world (as having reconciled their abstract individuality with the world), and focuses on their reaction to crisis. It then uses this reaction to replace the primary subject of study, which would be the institutions and historical actions that lead to the creation of so-called “shitholes”. This is comparable to analyzing a car crash by studying the bruised body parts of the passengers in the struck vehicle, while ignoring the drunk driver who ran the red light. Secondly, there is an intense process of atomization happening. By breaking down a political catastrophe into millions of individual moral choices, it makes the problem impossible to understand, let alone solve collectively. A political issue is then turned into a private moral one, which protects the agents &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; responsible by making their role disappear from view. This tactic is not new. It’s the standard alibi of empire. When a plantation system produces poverty and illiteracy, the owner blames the lazy and incapable nature of the enslaved. When a colony is left in ruins after extraction, the colonizer points to the corruption or tribalism of the natives. The focus on the flaws of the subjugated is then used to &lt;em&gt;retroactively&lt;/em&gt; justify subjugation. It says, in effect, “look at what these people do when left to their own devices”, while erasing the fact that they were never, in any meaningful sense, “left” to their own devices. Counterfactuals all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, take a look at the moral inconsistency. Do we ever apply this “individual responsibility” to the CEOs of mining companies that poison rivers, or AI data-centers which siphon electricity and pollute the environment? Or to the government officials who authorize coups and bombings? Almost never. For the powerful, we invoke systemic explanations- market forces, complex supply chains, geopolitical necessities such as “self-defense”. It&amp;rsquo;s only for the power&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; that personal failing is invoked. We see this same alibi in the retroactive justification of a death like George Floyd’s. The frantic search for a past mistake, noncompliance, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to atomize the event and justify the outcome, despite the reality of the flood of drugs into black neighborhoods, the destruction of the black family structure and subsequent degradation of morals, and the over-policing that made the killing possible in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s a pattern so relentless it forced the adoption of body cameras, which are a technology now that protects the &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt; public from the very state power that long operated with impunity. This atomizing logic is not an isolated phenomenon. It is the domestic manifestation of an older, more expansive project. This project is the deliberate campaign of social and economic disassembly waged internationally. In more incisive (and perhaps divisive depending on the reader) words, the &lt;em&gt;shithole&lt;/em&gt; and the suburb are two points on the same arc. To better grasp how this logic manifests at home, we must first trace its origins abroad. This way, the degeneracy we diagnose in shithole countries, and now fear in ourselves, is unmasked as the home-grown degeneracy of America, turned back in on itself. It is a highly domestic product, the original American logic of extraction and atomization, perfected abroad, now completing its global lap, and returning to dismantle the familial and civic foundations that, if America was ever great, constituted this American greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-external-project"&gt;The External Project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What may help in tracing this logic out, is in focusing on the aspect of colonialism that has to do with social engineering. The tools of conquest in a new region involve replacing organic political structures (organic here meaning ones that developed outside of intrusions on self-determined structures and sovereignty). This takes the form of tribal councils, kingdoms, and local governance structures that manage land and kinship being actively dismantled and replaced with extractive bureaucracies. Communal land, for example, was privatized to create individual owners, if not outright stolen, breaking the economic base of communities. If instead of communal ownership, an individual landowner or absentee corporate title held the reins, this shatters the social organism “native” to the environment. Colonialism here can perhaps be compared to an invasive species, however, this would obfuscate the nature of social and spiritual interactions between peoples. In effect, what was created were the optimal conditions for management and control of colonial territories. A population rendered legible, isolated, and dependent, can be considered the first act of disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, both the abstract tides shifted, meaning the world caught up to the framework of modernity, and the legitimizing ideologies of direct empire fell, and the concrete limitations of technological and military monopoly started to show themselves. For example, the material basis of direct imperialistic control was undermined. The sheer size of colonial territories ran into contradiction with the amount of informational coverage a given empire could supply, no doubt made worse by the two World Wars. Europe’s capacity for costly, direct administration was exhausted here. This, in the face of the rise of national liberation movements, made the model of occupation politically and militarily unsustainable. At the same time, the Cold War changed colonies from cash crops into geopolitical liabilities. Maintaining them risked pushing early nations into the opposing bloc. Due to these factors, and a whole confluence of forces, the flag-flying formal colony of the empire was made untenable. However, principles behind disassembly and control did not disappear, they became financialized and more abstract. This mutated the political form of a colony into the new political form of neocolonialism. Sovereignty was granted &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt;, but the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; reality was quite the opposite. True agency is vetoed through financial and institutional means, and so the imperial governor was replaced by the IMF loan officer, the colonial extraction quota was rebranded as a structural adjustment mandate, and the gunboat gave way to the corporate boardroom and “free trade” agreement. The project of disassembly continued, in new form, now operating through institutions of what are supposed to be considered international order, resulting in the creation of permanently indebted and politically vulnerable client states. Institutions of given neocolonial entities, shaped by “Structural Adjustment Plan” (SAP) mandates, were not and are not designed for public welfare or organic development. Their function is twofold. Firstly to service foreign debt, and secondly to facilitate the uninterrupted export of raw materials and resources. This political entity is hollowed out and serves as a toll-booth operator for transnational corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture of dependency was reinforced, of course, by ideological cover. Throughout the Cold War and into the post-9/11 “War on Terror” (particularly the USA PATRIOT Act), the support of brutal dictators and &lt;em&gt;deliberate&lt;/em&gt; fueling of proxy wars were justified under the banners of either containing communism, or fighting terror. What this accomplished was securing Western strategic interests (like military bases or votes at the UN), and guaranteed lucrative contracts for Western corporations. The consistent outcome was the deliberate sabotage of stable, self-determined political development. Having a functioning “democracy” with a diversified economy is a lot harder to “make use of” than desperate autocrats dependent on foreign arms and cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of the IMF and World Bank “experts”, economies were forcibly specialized into single-export exporters. Oil, cocoa, diamonds, copper, coffee. Internally, this destroyed the diversified local industries and agriculture, making entire nations hostages to volatile global (or rather Western) commodity prices. And so a failed coffee harvest, or a dip in copper demand, has the potential to collapse a national budget &lt;em&gt;overnight&lt;/em&gt;. This vulnerability was enshrined by an unfair global trade system, which finds Western nations maintaining immense agricultural subsidies and aggressive intellectual property regimes. For as much as the liberal democratic paradigm of individuals being free to compete in the market, allowing the “best” to win, a farmer in Ghana could not compete with subsidized American grain. A generic drug manufacturer in India could be sued for violating patents that kept lifesaving medicines expensive. So-called “free trade” agreements legally codify inequality, making it illegal for developing nations to protect their industries, subsidize food for their people, or achieve any sort of basis of sovereignty. Ultimately, debt becomes the primary tool of political control. Loans from SAPs and predatory international lenders act as political levers to enforce a continuous austerity. And so cuts to healthcare, education, infrastructure. No domestic capital is accumulated for meaningful internal investment. Any deviation from this prescribed neoliberal orthodoxy would trigger capital flight, the withholding of aid, and other mechanisms to punish deviation. The nation-state is then left with the hollow shell of a flag and an anthem, while its veins are tapped directly into the banks and meeting rooms of the former colonial metropole. This is the completed neocolonial project, the creation of nation states that are systematically prevented from ever becoming functionally sovereign. And so such “shitholes” are certainly not starting conditions. They are &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; manufactured end states. Even if there are aspects of a country which are not ideal, it is a problem the country itself needs to work through and confront. This is the bare minimum for seeing peoples as equals. However, if the moral argument does not appeal to someone, the result of these actions themselves have a reaction which will harm one if continuing to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="holocaust"&gt;Holocaust
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system just described reduces human societies to managed inputs and outputs. It hollows out states until their only purpose is extraction, and this justifies any violence required to maintain that flow. This doesn’t stand as a sentimental critique, just to be clear. Any logic, once perfected, develops a terrifying autonomy. It is not content to operate only on the designated “other” in some far away land to be out of sight, and out of mind. It seeks &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; frontiers, new efficiencies. To believe this capacity for disassembly and extraction could be permanently quarantine in the colonies is quite a dangerous fantasy. The 20th century delivered the definitive rebuttal to that fantasy by proving, in detail, that the abattoir built for the periphery, could very well be reconstructed in the heart of the metropole. In the purest expression of colonial logic, it comes home in the form of the holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holocaust was the application of this entire colonial operation to a people who were, despite the complaints of some, intrinsically a European phenomenon, and as such not a “foreign” imposition on the “pure” West. The Jewish people were not a distant colonized other, they were doctors, neighbors, poets, and of course bankers, woven into Europe’s intellectual and cultural fabric for around a millennium. This is what makes it the foundational trauma of modernity. It exemplifies the fact that the logic, developed &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the “shithole”, recognizes no final boundary. Not even the boundary of the self. How can gas chambers be a regression to barbarism? They were the logical endpoint of a modernity built on disassembly, efficiency, and the bureaucratic management of life deemed unworthy of it (hence, &lt;em&gt;lebensunwertes Leben&lt;/em&gt;). Thus, the degeneracy we assign to failed states is a profound projection. The degeneracy was never &lt;em&gt;in them&lt;/em&gt;, it was a latent operational capacity within the modern Western system itself. Even still, this will be met with the drones of empire, which misinterpret this fact for the exclusion of individual responsiblity. The ultimate exercise of responsibility is in recognizing one’s past actions, and enabling others to live freely and responsibly, it is not found in the broad abstract assertion of individual responsibility. And so, this is the fundamental significance of the holocaust. Not in death toll, or in the mere tragedy of fact, although these should not be scoffed at. The significance of the holocaust was that it was what Europe was doing colonially, projected back onto itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post-war world recoils from this event, but it never dismantled the underlying logic. It let it evolve into the neocolonialism of today by redirecting and re-domesticating its most extreme expressions, while preserving its economic and bureaucratic centrality. The colonial and neocolonial project of disassembly continued, as we have seen. And as it continues, it generates another consequence: migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern invasion panic (at least in America, which I assume you are from, but is also being repeated in other Western states) finds its historical cause in the system of globalism previously outlined. Migration flows are certainly not &lt;em&gt;random&lt;/em&gt;. They follow lines of capital and disruption. People do not leave a thriving, self-determining societies en masse, unless something has gone terribly wrong. Something like destabilization, which points them away from the economically plundered periphery, toward the centers of political and financial power that orchestrated that blunder. The migrant, in this case, can’t &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; be an invading foreigner. Instead, they are a living reflection of the global order, a person following the path of extracted resources back to their source. They’re just following the money. And so, we find the system’s final ironic extraction; we find here the extraction of human capital itself. After stripping the land of minerals, monopolizing the agriculture, and loading the state with debt, the system now attracts the most desperate, and often the most ambitious and patriotic, survivors. They come to serve as cheap labor, or as a result of the &lt;em&gt;brain drain&lt;/em&gt;, in the aging atomized economies of the West. The question must now be asked: are such countries “invading” America because they are essentially bad, and after destroying &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; states, they’re coming to destroy ours? Or is their perceived “badness” a reflection of the process found within the Western countries themselves? The truth is that degeneracy we project onto the world is a diagnosis of our own condition. The West is not being invaded by a foreign decay, it is itself degenerating from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="internal-degeneracy"&gt;Internal Degeneracy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having disassembled societies abroad, the system inevitably, and simultaneously, turns on its own, finding a home in the most intimate space of all: the domestic sphere. The shithole is not “over there”. It’s generating principle is here, dissolving the foundations of American life from within, as domestic as apple pie. All of what I have described in colonial states bear a striking resemblance to things that have happened here in America. The colonial state was one founded in conquest and settled under the pretenses of democracy, capitalism, and everything good about the West, and in its maturity, increasingly manifested as an entity under the control of corporate and financial interests. The colonial state then hollowed out public institutions, from education to infrastructure, and sacrificed the common good on the altar of private profit. We have, in essence, the same process happening in our own society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiar pathologies return. We have the loneliness epidemic, classified now on par with smoking. The logical end-state of the atomized individual engineers a world of infinite digital proximity and physical exile, where people curate their personas, or profiles, while atrophying. This is the finished product of a logic that prioritizes manageable units over messy, interdependent wholes. Where the colonial project broke (or intended to break) communal ties to better control a population, the domestic counterpart has succeeded in making us strangers to each other, and to ourselves. Skyrocketing rates of depression and “deaths of despair” (deaths by suicide, alcoholism, overdose, etc.) are signs of a failing culture. Life is reduced to transactions and career milestones, and truly, it is a rational response to the question of “what is it all for?”. The market provides no answer beyond “more”, and the state offers only the thin purporting of safety and (might I add bureaucratic) procedure. The self, having become transactional, defines us by consumption and what we do for a living, or which political faction we perform a hatred for (which itself is a type of consumption). Every other foundation for identity, whether it&amp;rsquo;s family, faith, or craft, has been rendered a commodity or dismantled altogether, if not in the process of currently being dismantled. The most damning pathology is a cultural abandonment of the vulnerable. Firstly, yes, in the sense that our individual sides are gate-kept from others, unless interfaced through the aforementioned profiles and personas of consumption. But also in the sense of those who can’t compete, such as the very young, the elderly, and the disabled. &lt;em&gt;Their&lt;/em&gt; systematic institutionalization is handed over to the for-profit care industry as, among other things, a collapse of intergenerational duty. And so childhood and parental care are no longer sacred responsibilities, they are turned into cost-centers, or problems to be managed rather than people. This is a chilling domestic reminder of the colonial logic that deemed unproductive populations expendable. Just as the colonial “state” abroad abandoned the common welfare for the flow of resources, the market-state at home abandons the bonds of care for the flow of capital. In a sense, we have not advanced beyond the principle of the workhouse. It has been democratized and slapped with a mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand at the tail end of this logic. The tool crafted to disassemble has done what it was supposed to do, with an intense potency. To the degree that it disassembled those that employed the tool in the first place. The “shithole” is no longer an external destination for our contempt or charity, it is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; domestic condition. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; live in a shithole country. These things we point to as social ills, the destruction of social institutions, public education, health problems, increasing cost of living, they are not problems of some &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt; source. They are the logic of our own system, now consuming its point of origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Paradise Found: Refuge from Tartarus and a Depraved World</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/paradise-found-refuge-from-tartarus-and-a-depraved-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/paradise-found-refuge-from-tartarus-and-a-depraved-world/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://imgc.artprintimages.com/img/print/hieronymus-bosch-the-ascent-into-the-empyrean-or-highest-heaven_u-l-q1he6li0.jpg?artHeight=550&amp;artPerspective=n&amp;artWidth=550&amp;background=fbfbfb" alt="Featured image of post Paradise Found: Refuge from Tartarus and a Depraved World" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Below is an article written a long ago.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It lies not far from Temple-Bar. Going to it, by the usual way, is like stealing from a heated plain into some cool, deep glen, shady among harboring hills. Sick with the din and soiled with the mud of Fleet Street &amp;ndash; where the Benedick tradesmen are hurrying by, with ledger-lines ruled along their brows, thinking upon rise of bread and fall of babies &amp;ndash; you adroitly turn a mystic corner &amp;ndash; not a street &amp;ndash; glide down a dim, monastic way flanked by dark, sedate, and solemn piles, and still wending on, give the whole care-worn world the slip, and, disentangled, stand beneath the quiet cloisters of the Paradise of Bachelors.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening lines of Herman Melville’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/SAYLOR-ENGL405-5.2-PARADISE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Paradise of Bachelors and Tartarus of Maids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; depict an almost prophetic vision of the modern age. It unfolds in two scenes, in which an unnamed narrator guides us through both. He remains unnamed throughout the tale, however he discloses that by trade he is a seedsman, a traveling businessman who deals with what the name implies. The quote above begins the exposition of the &lt;em&gt;Paradise of Bachelors&lt;/em&gt;. Away from the filth and grime of Victorian London, away from the busy streets of worldly concerns and of practical worries, lies a sanctuary with a mystical and sacred quality to it. This sanctuary, once the proud domain of the Knights Templar, now houses the shadows of their former presence. Men exist, undoubtedly, but not men of the order. The men here have no care for customs or tradition, neglecting their duties and growing lazy in their paradise. For them, there are peaceful gardens to lounge in, representing the ideal inner mind of an order member. There is a library, the presence of which would underscore the Templar&amp;rsquo;s fervent pursuit of knowledge as the heights of their organization. Finally, there is a chapel. They are knights of Christ, after all. Despite these facilities being at hand for the bachelors, ready to be utilized in the appropriate manner, the capstone of this Paradise is the dining experience that the seedsman and the bachelors indulge in. Indulge being the key here, for the life of consumption and apathy portrayed by the bachelors is one that rivals the likes of the lotus-eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story opens by contrasting this Paradise with the world. One, a heavenly resort for the Templars, supposedly above the earthly struggles. The other, the harsh reality of industrial London, representing the modern world. Immediately one can tell that this “paradise” mimics the horrors of a &lt;em&gt;utilitarian&lt;/em&gt; paradise, a parody of Heaven. Perhaps Melville’s depiction of this scene acts as a critique of Benthamite utility as the principle of the Good. It was certainly picking up steam during London’s industrial period. The more important point is that this is a common trend when conceiving of the infinite Heaven; that of the extension of the finite indefinitely. Finitude, in this case satiation, is extended as far as it can go: Satiation is ‘Good’, and so you will erase the bad of unsatiation for good, so that nothing stands in its way. Through this method it is thought that one has achieved Heaven, the ultimate satiation. Unfortunately, here it acts as a cancer. Satiation wants to extend itself into what is its other until it is all that is left. It then has no purpose or &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; purpose and subsequently has destroyed its own structure, much like cancer has no purpose other than to reproduce and suffocate all until it kills its host along with itself. What does it mean to &lt;em&gt;satiate&lt;/em&gt; that which cannot be &lt;em&gt;satiated&lt;/em&gt;? For the bachelors it means a consumption that invokes perpetual hunger, gnawing at what it cannot have since it does not have &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;. This description of paradise is not all different from the scene of underclass industrial London workers. They, too, work and toil endlessly, sacrificing themselves on the altar of modern society and industrialization, trying to satisfy what fundamentally cannot be satisfied in this way. This sanctuary in actuality represents not Paradise above the world, but the subservience to worldliness. The bachelors have replaced their iron boots for leather. They have exchanged their mighty swords for pens. The sage-like spiritual guidance and advice given freely to all now comes with a price. And the defense of the Holy Sepulcher has become a hindrance for bureaucracy. The bachelors of today are only Templars in name. In looking to the worldly to determine the heavenly, they have been hollowed out by secular society. This paradise is the description of an eternal torment that has left the Templars as vestigial remnants of the Temple of Solomon, the wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maids fare worse. The second scene follows the seedsman traveling to a desolate winter environment in New England. Entering a hollow aptly named the “Devil’s Dungeon”, he finds his way onto a prison-like paper mill. At first the seedsman does not see the paper mill since the landscape is a bright white that makes discernment difficult. Not a brilliant white indicative of purity and spiritual life, but the pale, lifeless light of a spectral kind. Inside the mill are rows and rows of young women with blank expressions lacking vitality, folding blank paper that the machine(s) produce. Other maids are doing various tasks. The difference in scenery starts to contrast itself almost immediately, as even the seedsman&amp;rsquo;s mind is taken back to the bachelor’s paradise when confronted with this harsh and cruel environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully grasp a work&amp;rsquo;s content, we must move beyond the limitations of immediate presentation and engage with it as a totality. It is said that the Monkey’s Paw of representation is the independence of what is essential, being restricted to what is immediately shown. Whether it is the audience&amp;rsquo;s limitations, or the work&amp;rsquo;s content pitted against itself, this approach assumes a false distinction. In reality, the content of a work can only be accessed and understood through it in reference to the whole of the content. Instead of privileging isolated interpretations of a work&amp;rsquo;s content, we should consider how specific elements are portrayed within the context of the entirety. This approach recognizes the interplay between individual elements and the overall meaning, where each informs and shapes the other. This is because the work&amp;rsquo;s meaning cannot be extracted like removing the skeleton from flesh, but rather emerges from the interconnectedness of the work with itself as its content to form the &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; of the work. When analyzing a story, one can delve into the way the content presents itself in specific cases, such as the narrative structure, the author&amp;rsquo;s use of literary tools, or the different themes and aspects of the story. However, this can be done only in connection with the totality of the work if the interpretation is to be true to the work’s message, and not a projection belonging to the subject. Being dynamic in this way, art lends itself to meaning that validly explicates itself on multiple levels and from multiple perspectives. This can serve as an indication of good art: the conveyance of multi-layered &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;. Good art brings to consciousness ideals that we may not find in everyday life, one that reveals a deeper agreement between &lt;em&gt;what is&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; and penetrates layman conceptions. It is to my dismay, then, that Melville’s story &lt;em&gt;The Paradise of Bachelor’s and the Tartarus of Maids&lt;/em&gt; has not gotten its due credit, being overshadowed by that maddening, enigmatic, and awe-inspiring white whale. On the other hand, it is not surprising that the main invocation of this story is in the halls of academia, with its employment of “lens” analysis. After choosing a lens to view the story through and picking which elements fit this interpretation, there is only the discarding of all else — the aforementioned separation of the skeleton and the flesh, which turns both lifeless and inept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not without standing, interpretations of the story as a critique of child labor, gender dynamics, or as a Marxist critique cannot be disqualified. The story is dense and is full of elements you can pick and choose from. The phallic and yonic imagery is everywhere. For example, the description of the Devil’s Dungeon which is in a hooper shape and a river that runs red with a blood-like color is the most explicit allusion to female genitalia. The paper mill standing tall and erected is the contrary. The bachelor’s boots turning from hardened steel to softened leather fits in with the broader theme of the inversion of traditional masculinity and femininity. Masculinity being the active and penetrating energy, with femininity being the passive and arbitrating one. In the story, there is an inversion going on where the Templars lose their virility and become soft, passive bachelors. The maids are forced to work and sharpen the scythes used in the paper-making process, which the seedsman compares to the blades guards use to transport prisoners. This implies their willingness to participate in their own subjectivity. Another overarching theme is that of social inequality. The bachelors lounge in their paradise, and maids work at the cost of their life force in order to “keep the machine going”. This can be combined with the “Marxist lens” of class struggle to focus on the brutality of what workers face in industrial era London. Additionally, there is also commentary on the psychology of indulgence. The reason that &lt;em&gt;good art&lt;/em&gt; is universal, timeless, and can be analyzed for a great deal of time and with a wide range of perspectives is because its content is &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, with such a content, art can seem to transcend time being prophetic, and transcend place being universal. Its message is telling you how something &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be by invoking sensuousness like visual or auditory stimulus. How something should be is how it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be, or else it won’t be. In the case of Melville’s story, he provides us with a cautionary tale which at first glance appears to be a negative story, merely about what human nature is not. Upon further examination, there is a reason Melville uses the Templars as opposed to any other fraternity to represent a “fall from grace”. There is a reason that he name-drops Brian de Bois-Guilbert from Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, as a way to reference what the bachelors have become. The reason is that the mission of the Templars is the universal mission and ultimate purpose of man: Freedom. On top of this, the fall of man that the bachelors represent in this story mirrors the fall of man &lt;em&gt;as such&lt;/em&gt;. For this reason, I wish to highlight a neglected aspect in this story and in modern times, exposing what we have lost in the modern day in hopes that we can once again attain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the relationship between freedom and the Templars? Why must I refer a group of heretics instead of rallying people towards the Church for salvation? Firstly, let me impart with you a secret about the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ, the Templars. They follow Christ unquestionably. Yet they worship implicitly someone, or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, far older. They worship Sophia. The Templars, despite what the Catholic Church might say, are not worshipers of Baphomet (although it has been hypothesized that using an Atbash cipher, &lt;em&gt;Baphomet&lt;/em&gt; becomes &lt;em&gt;Sophia&lt;/em&gt;). They are not guilty of the crime of making profane everything Christianity stands for. The group started as early as 1096 in Constantinople, originating from a group of French families with Gnostic and Cathar (Albigensian) backgrounds collaborating with a Kabbalist named Rashi and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who secretly practiced Druidism. Two members of this group, Godfrey de Saint-Omer and Hugues de Payens, a founder with Islamic mystical background (what we call Sufism these days), were sent to Constantinople with a mission to safeguard and collect knowledge, artifacts, and technologies from pre-flood civilizations. Their quest also includes the collection of apocryphal and Gnostic texts. In Constantinople, they met with a scholar from a Pythagorean order. After being initiated in the Pythagorean secret tradition, they then set forth to find these hidden treasures before the Crusaders did and preserve them for those deemed worthy. The reason being that there was a fear that the Crusaders (with the Crusades starting a year earlier in 1095) would come across the artifacts/treasures and relinquish ownership to the Roman Church, where they would inevitably disappear. The primary intent of the order was immediately to prevent this, but more broadly to usher in a new level of consciousness in the world through these recovered secrets, in this case a European Renaissance. This is the history according to the modern day mystery schools that claim Templar lineage. The reverence for Sophia (wisdom) is not only implicit in the Cathar founding, but with Pythagorean initiation as the birth of the organization. After all, Pythagoras is the one that coined the term &lt;em&gt;philo-Sophia&lt;/em&gt; (love of wisdom). By way of Gnosticism, there is also &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_the_grand_master_of_the_Knights_Templar#Abraxas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;circumstantial evidence&lt;/a&gt; with a seal of Abraxas that lends credence to the explicit Gnostic-Sophic-Templar connection, although it is still circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am first thought, the thought that is in light. I am movement that is in all, she in whom the realm of all takes its stand, the firstborn among those who came into being, she who exists before all. She is called by three names, although she exists alone, since she is perfect. I am invisible within the thought of the invisible one. I am revealed in the immeasurable, ineffable things. I am intangible, dwelling in the intangible. I move in every creature.
&lt;br&gt;I am the life of my afterthought that is within every power and every eternal movement, and in invisible lights, and within the powers and angels and demons and every soul in Tartaros, and in every material soul. I live in those who came into being. I move in everyone and I enter them. I walk upright, and those who sleep I awaken. And I am the sight of those who dwell in sleep.
&lt;br&gt;I am the invisible one in all. I counsel those who are hidden, since I know the whole realm of all that exists in it. I am numberless beyond everyone. I am immeasurable, ineffable, yet whenever I wish, I shall reveal myself. I am the head of all. I am before all, and I am all, since I am in everyone.”&lt;/em&gt;

&gt;Three Forms of First Thought (Trimorphic Protennoia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophia occupies a central position in Gnostic mythology. The concept stems from the Greek notion of absolute wisdom, as explored by Pythagoras after his extended studies in Egypt. This idea was later adopted by the Hebrew Essenes. In the 10th century, following a period of suppression of the feminine divine, Kabbalah revived this ancient belief. This revival reintroduced the concept of God as both Mother and Daughter along with Father and Son, supposedly offering a clearer picture of the soul&amp;rsquo;s structure through &lt;em&gt;shekinah&lt;/em&gt;. The story of Sophia is as follows: In the beginning there is One God and his emanations, the Aeons. The Aeons all have their pairings, except Sophia. In terms of divine “energy”, which precedes its instantiation as incarnation in the world, there is the unity of the Divine as both Father and Mother in a state called the Pleroma, the perfect, immaterial world. Sophia as the divine Daughter is separated from this unity and eventually started &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt;, or emanating indiscriminately (without Logos), creating the unbalanced imperfect material world. Already we can intuit that one-sided determination is never the full picture. A full apprehension of both sides of the divine is required as a metaphor and actual condition for completeness. A side effect of this world being created in an unbalanced state is the genesis of the Demiurge, &lt;em&gt;Yaldabaoth&lt;/em&gt; (or the archon Yahweh, which in the Valentinian tradition is the one responsible for the creation of the material world), who is the lord of the material domain. In the disruption of the perfect immaterial world and the creation of the material, Sophia is trapped in the form of human souls and left without an Aeon to match with her. The Demiurge has as their job to keep the soul of man trapped in the material world, however it can only be done through self-imposed ignorance. As a result, the One God sends down an Aeon to match with Sophia so that we can know her within us and thus know completeness. This Aeon is Christ the Father incarnate, the most perfect Aeon. He ushers us to Gnosis, the unification of both divine principles. This, in broad terms, is the Gnostic mythos and the end goal of Gnosticism. The story of Christ from this perspective is once again the story of the salvation of man. It is the story of divinity or immaterial as presupposition for the worldly or material, returning to itself as divine. It is the story of the grace God gives us to join with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not entirely Gnostic, I can recognize some truths about the myth. Truths that seem universal, for one. The import of Gnosticism is also the import of religions of the past. God without and God within, immanence and transcendence unified by love. Love here as the speculative moment. It is the moment of reconciliation, both intersubjectively and between subject and object. For example, between two individuals of equal standing or between God and man. It is the all-unifying principle of oneness found, yet &lt;em&gt;obscured&lt;/em&gt;, in the exoteric Christian religion as opposed to the religion of exoteric Judaism which has only &lt;em&gt;law&lt;/em&gt; as its unification. Such a unification is an empty and formal one that sources its determination externally. However, the unification of love can be applied and used at this very moment. One only needs to look within the heart and engage with this alchemy that Jesus calls &lt;em&gt;the Way&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Way&lt;/em&gt; is this process of unification and its result as totality, as in the case of the sacred union of Christ (Christos, the Son) and Mary Magdalene (an incarnation of Sophia, the Daughter). Throughout history, the Divine Feminine and Masculine, as incarnated in figures like Thoth, Isis, Osiris, Brigid, Allat, Lakshmi, Ishtar, the Sufis, and Daoists (who literally practice &lt;em&gt;The Way&lt;/em&gt;), have consistently imparted the same profound wisdom. This wisdom is echoed in the teachings of nature-centric religions that revere the Divine Mother. Then there are truths that seem prophetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the challenges we face today stem from one-sided determination. This can manifest in various ways, such as low self-confidence leading to difficulties in personal and romantic relationships. Addictions to harmful substances like alcohol, pornography, gambling, or sex can create significant problems. Furthermore, unchecked ego and a lack of foresight can lead us to prioritize things that ultimately harm us, like excessive attention or material wealth. These one-sided pursuits bind us to earthly matters, and hinders our ability to achieve freedom or self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, like the Devil Tarot (and in the case of the Demiurge), this confinement is voluntary. Once we awaken and realize who we truly are by seeing what must be through wisdom, we can see that the chains of illusion are chained to &lt;em&gt;illusions&lt;/em&gt;— Ideal moments of something greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides of divinity incarnate themselves on Earth for us as the divine Son and Daughter, Christ and Sophia. Enough has been considered regarding these incarnated principles &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; us in everyday discourse. You do not need me to tell you about how you must accept Jesus in your heart. We will then shift our focus to the often-overlooked feminine aspect of divinity, Sophia, as it manifests immanently &lt;em&gt;in us&lt;/em&gt;. We will explore how this inherent wisdom can guide us and how we can cultivate it in our lives. It may be that neglect does not begin to describe what we have done to wisdom, given that &lt;em&gt;Sophia&lt;/em&gt; is the engine by which man realizes himself. We have a drive to wisdom such that what seems to be neglected reiterates itself and brings forth itself constantly. We have it in us to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;. As much as someone can protest that they do not need to know in order for self-actualization, what is the case is that they act with respect to truth in an objective manner. Without the knowledge of what is the case and what should be the case, the move towards how to live and what decisions one needs to make can theoretically never begin. Yet it does— &lt;em&gt;Eppur si muove&lt;/em&gt;. Despite these protests, people still act and live with that animating principle of guidance, only with the Sophia within us repressed and begging to be let out. We can reside in ignorance when confronted with this fact, or take the other move. The other move is to figure out, using the wisdom in us, what the truth is. A question that might arise at this point is, “Why is the truth good? Who cares about the truth”? The answer is simple. This is a matter of absolute ontology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onto-logy-and-self-determination-or-freedom"&gt;Onto-logy and Self-determination, or Freedom
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ask what the point of truth is, is to ask what the point of things being what they are is. In this sense, the “way things are” and the “way things should be” are deeply intertwined. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there&amp;rsquo;s no room for discrepancy. We can encounter situations where things are not as they should be, like with sick bodies or dysfunctional states. However, these do not exist for very long, eventually succumbing to the disintegration with respect to the discrepancy of &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ought to be&lt;/em&gt;. The search for truth is not just about uncovering “facts”, but also the uncovering of the inherent “ought” within things. By understanding how something should be, we gain a deeper understanding of how it actually is, and vice versa. If we take this pursuit of truth to its ultimate conclusion, we arrive at a fundamental question: why haven’t you killed yourself? This is not a call to violence, but a way to highlight the nature of the question of being and its truth. On a fundamental level, the question of being and its truth in being &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, or being &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, is as necessary as it is obvious. The alternative is self-destruction. Since there is, nothing can’t exist. The nothing people think of is in actuality the pureness of being which is identical with nothing. But nonetheless it is a &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; that is. This is the beginning of the onto-logical investigation soon to be introduced and a testament to the relationship between ontology, wisdom, and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analogy to see this link of wisdom with self-determination is to imagine a musician that has no training in music theory. They are not precluded from being great musicians. However everything they make that is good in terms of music, will have been made completely by accident. The same can be said for individuals who live without thought. It is definitely possible to live a good life. But this good life is not guided by knowledge of what is good. It is achieved by an intuition which may be false, or by complete blind faith, which can lead us astray. Plato can attest, who viewed Sophia as the link to virtuosity and justice. In Plato’s Republic, Sophia is embodied in the Philosopher-King, who rules the Republic guided by what should be, rather than being strung along by their own subjective desires. Sophia is not just limited to the ruler. In the Symposium, Plato correctly identifies wisdom as a form of love. When we engage with Sophia, we are rightfully in marriage with our true nature as thinking beings. Note that this is not merely conjecture. Plato is making an ontological claim of human nature and how humans should act based on how we are. Truth is good because the truth leads to good. Respectively, the Good is the truth that goodness leads to. It is once again this agreement between what ought to be the case (the concept) and what is the case (the object). The truth of man ought to be actual, since it leads to the fuller embodiment of what we already are. What we are is the embodiment of what we are conceptually determined to be. The way to grasp this truth is with Sophia, who happens to be what we find our truth in. It might be confusing that the method by which we attain such content is itself the content. How can it be that we are thinking beings and that we must think to arrive at what thought is? On the contrary, think about the weight this holds. Purpose is always internal to the thing which has purposiveness. Consider terms like love and friend taken in their ordinary usage. To be true love is the agreement of the love concept (what it should be, ideally) with what it is in actuality. If the action is anything but the union that the love concept determines and its object, then what is being investigated is not love. Who among us would call an abusive relationship a loving one? Who among us would call a backstabber and liar a friend? Things are ultimately determined by themselves and not from anything exclusively outside of them. It is for this reason that wisdom as thought must be determined by thought. We exist freely to determine ourselves as well. Do not mistake this for the abstract freedom from responsibility or from the laws of governance. Such freedom is abstract and has no actuality. The freedom I am speaking of only comes with the encompassing of externally imposed limits, and a recognition of those limits as constituting the conditions by which autonomy can become itself. The autonomy that follows is then freedom in the truest sense, a freedom which is not finite in cause since it incorporates all possibilities in its determination. In our case, and in the case of finding the truth of all things, we do so with our love and marriage of wisdom as a realization of who we are implicitly made explicit. We cannot use purpose that is exclusively outside of us to be free. This same freedom applies to all concepts, for if the integrity of a structure is broken, the entire structure falls apart. The integrity of love cannot be determined by anything love is not. For example, love cannot be determined by a monetary transaction since it is not in love to be a formal and contractual relation of this kind. This truth of self-determination is what the Templars have realized. Finally, we have the connection between their object of veneration and freedom. Freedom is self-determination. The Templars reify the Sophic nature implicit in man and recognize that we can all freely determine ourselves, if we choose to do so. Tasking themselves with safeguarding the treasures of mankind for those who can commit to this duty, in Melville’s work the Templars have desecrated this belief and themselves. The maids are stuck in the world of the Demiurge, forced to work with no benefit to themselves or anything greater, stuck in Tartarus. Similarly, mankind in the modern day has lost its own search for wisdom and is instead tugged on by the ropes of what is worldly and untrue. Reintroducing Sophia is the medicine for the sickness demonstrated here and one we will subsequently expose. In the end, Sophia is fittingly known as the Virgin of the World by Hermes Trismegistus, being unimpregnated by outside determination and manifesting as self-determination, pregnant with itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us return briefly to the protest of claims to knowledge, since it is the expression of a trend in the contemporary age. The protest appears as something along the lines of a counterclaim against claims of truth. When one claims to have the capital T truth, the absolute grounding of what is the case, the reaction is that such a person is hubristic. “How dare they claim positive knowledge of what is? Claim humble stupidity like the rest of us!” If I am to be honest, this response isn’t unfounded, especially when the initial claim comes unprompted. You are handing away your authority to someone that &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; what is good [for you] and reacting in such a way to protect your self-determination. However, the issue here comes from seeking refuge from the false claim of absolute knowledge under the auspice of the false claim of subjectivism. This will only lead you into a deeper falsity. Additionally, there is a secret premise snuck into this response. The secret premise is that the &lt;em&gt;counterclaim itself claims absolute knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. Saying in one breath that absolute objectivity cannot exist since everything is subjective absolutely is a direct contradiction and disproof. In reality, the claim of hubris here is a projection of the hubristic claim of &lt;em&gt;already having the truth&lt;/em&gt;, which is purely immediate subjectivity. The greatest hubris lies in believing that accepting the limitations of your own uninterrogated understanding is enough. It suggests a complacency with the coarseness of our finite purposes, a refusal to acknowledge anything beyond our immediate needs and desires. There is a variant of this position which is of the utmost cowardice. It bypasses claims to knowledge by offloading the burden of the absolute to another source. You may have come across an evangelical or two, or someone that says “look how pious I am, for I do not claim any truths. I merely follow the Quran or the Bible, the ultimate truth”. Yet, the wisdom or logic inherent in us is what sanctions and arbitrates these Holy Books as true. It is nothing short of cowardice to hide behind another source and posture it as your sole determiner. Another example is that of the science believer. One who claims that this machinery of science is what we use to understand things, but that science itself is not capable of certainty. It is merely the best tool we have to understand the world around us, but it &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; make absolute claims. The reason that rather than saying the laws of science or physics are &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; (or in referring to the “experts”, which calls again into question how one can even know to trust experts) is because science is a product of the human mind, rather than a revelation from the divine mind which has absolute knowledge. Thus, it cannot be the source of objective and absolute knowledge. How dysfunctional of a system! If we are using an open-ended method of analysis which cannot even agree on an object of analysis to begin with, let alone the objectivity of the concepts it employs, what is the point of privileging science? The point that is revealed is that this form of “science” begins on flawed ground. This contemporary attitude is not only the projection of hubris, but it is the manifestation of the guilt of our constant masturbation. I do not mean this to be crude or only to describe self-indulgence, either. This is a matter far more sinister than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel Kant can help us comprehend this attitude deeper. In his argument against masturbation, he claims that sexuality outside monogamous marriage leads to objectification. In the case of masturbation, the loved person is reduced to a mere object of appetite. Once this desire is fulfilled, they are to be discarded with no further consideration since they have served their purpose. This eliminates any moral obligation towards the other person, as they are seen as nothing more than a thing to be used and disposed of. However, there is another aspect of objectification that Kant mentions, and it involves the folly of one-sided determination. As you are objectifying the “quote unquote” actor or actress, are turning yourself into an object— you turn yourself into a mere tool to satiate appetite. Within the Kantian paradigm, the Categorical Imperative, this is a fatal error as people are ends. To turn them into means for your own ends is to destroy the structure of you in terms of your ethical obligations, as well as destroying the social fabric connecting you to other people. Moreover, Kant says that masturbation is worse than the horror of killing yourself as it debases you below the status of a beast, involving both self-destruction and surrendering to animal instincts. Below an animal, since a beast cannot debase itself into its animalistic impulses, as it already exists within an animalistic state. A similar dynamic is the account of the contemporary attitude. When one is confronted with an object or work, be it a form of art, theology, or philosophy, the attitude is to approach the work with objectification in mind. Rather than this product being the object we subject ourselves to and learn from, we treat the work as what must subject itself to ourselves as object. We do not take the object as it determines itself. Then we must demand that the work makes itself suitable for us, or else its overall significance is irrelevant since it is not relevant for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The onus of pedagogical clarity should not fall solely on the object being examined. While acknowledging the complexities with certain philosophers, a core responsibility lies with the prospective student. This responsibility is to attempt to parse the meaning they confront and understand the concepts being employed, rather than shape what these concepts are as themselves to the student&amp;rsquo;s current understanding. In the case of theological traditions, the guilt that originates from this attitude is embraced as the concept of the unknowable Absolute where awe, blind faith, and the refusal to acknowledge us as being able to know supersedes comprehension. The irony lies in the paradoxical notion that delineating and defining the Absolute constitutes it as knowable. The realm of aesthetics grapples with this attitude as the problem of taste, addressed through a hedonistic lens. This problem can be described as the subjective judgment of art and its supposed disconnect with objective value. The hedonistic solution appeals to sensibility as the legitimacy of judgment, while overdetermining the objective aspect that stands independent to external determination. Aphorisms like “art is subjective” or “art only has the meaning we give it” reduce the consumer to the detriment of the artwork itself, ultimately turning the consumer into a mere instrument of self-gratification. This attitude can be extended to the ideologies we use as well. Take the cowardice of the proponents of evolutionary psychology. Such individuals take this theory that conflates a tautological how with a why. Tautological, since the claims made by this field can be represented as the initial claim being present in the conclusion in a different form. According to evolutionary psychology, our behavior is dependent on our evolution as a species. Thus, if a behavior does not have an affinity with evolution (reproduction and self maintenance), it has no significance. Yet all behaviors do have this relation. The boundaries of what fits in and out of evolution has no limit, and so every behavior can be justified and validated as a result of our evolution. There is no need to appeal to any independence or self-determination because we are largely dependent on evolution to control our psychology. A typical example of how this process plays out is as such: I am 6 foot and 7 inches, so I can attract a mate because I stand out. Why is this noteworthy? In the past, being bigger meant being able to defend myself, my tribe, or my mate. This is good. Therefore, being tall is good. The quality of tallness is not taken as what it is or what it is in a given context. It is subservient to ends which are already predetermined outside what it is predicated to. When a woman wears makeup, it is not because she has decided to, but because the potential attraction of a mate is what steered her to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is enslaved to the principle of evolution, which is elevated to absolute truth. Similarly, the trend of Marxism which privileges a deterministic view of human action abdicates accountability. The conditions by which you explain your scenario, whatever that may be, is mistaken for the reason you are in your scenario. These conditions are named &lt;em&gt;material conditions&lt;/em&gt; and account for everything in existence, since everything has a cause (assumed to be material). It then follows that the &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; for any human action is the material cause, or the condition by which an action follows. The poor do not commit crime because they have free will and have gone through a decision-making process in which a crime will benefit them in some way. The poor commit crime because they are helpless pawns to material conditions. How can it be &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; if it excludes the role of the subject in arbitrating their decisions? This is not to say that context does not color this decision-making process or to serve as a defense of the status quo. Only to demonstrate the error and patronizing that comes with this way of thinking. The analysis of the contemporary attitude can be exhausting for quite a while. In addition, it will lead to other discussion topics like that of cause and effect, which I do not wish to focus on here. Essentially, Kant’s argument against masturbation correctly identifies the process of degrading yourself. What great shame it is to have nothing more out of common with a beast than consumption that is guided by a state of self-objectification. The beast cannot appreciate good taste because it cannot develop good taste. However, a person can. The beast does not know the difference between steak tartare and raw cattle, or between rock music with high overdrive and screeching metal in a factory. In the same vein, the layman looks upon an objective as if it were a pornographic actor or actress serving the purpose of satisfying our subjective needs and discards any independent purpose it may be presenting us with. This results in a double-sided degradation of yourself and the object. What we have here in the contemporary era is a culture of masturbation. Perhaps we must take a page from JFK’s book. When you read &lt;em&gt;Fictions&lt;/em&gt; by Borges, and it doesn’t “do anything for you”, ask not what it can do for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, but what you can do for &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having now become acquainted with Sophia and the dominant trend which prohibits her, this allows us to uncover the groundwork for the exploration of wisdom, and for wisdom to explore itself. The way in which we approach this is by pure thought as it becomes cognition capable of conceptual comprehension. This includes the comprehension of itself. Why wisdom must explore itself, aside from it necessarily being the case via self-determination, is so that it does not act prematurely and leave room for error. For something to have wisdom is for thought to have turned it over in and for thought. This is why thought must be the one to give us wisdom, and why thought needs to investigate what it is on its own terms so that it can help us understand what other things are. This is also the point of departure for many people, as it involves a departure from the worldly as well as the everyday idea of thought in practice. We are delving into thought and pure thought alone, with no pre-given content to work with. Only the exploration of what is necessary and there. Another reason that we must use thought is since Logic (the science of thinking) is the tool that never leaves us. There is logic, or in other words a relationality, in everything. There is a structure in what it means to be a rock. It has relationality with itself and everything around it. There is logic in the way a chair is [structured]. There is a logic to our decision-making. There is logic to a tree and its development. There is relationality in the claims a skeptic makes, otherwise they cannot make any claims at all. There is even a logic to madness. Relationality is relationality no matter the context. Despite being a departure from the worldly, we find structure, or relationality, in everything, including the worldly. One cannot claim that this exploration is a mere product of the mind since this division between relationality as a faculty (implying it is subjective and has no independent standing) and relationality of an absolute kind, has no justified grounding. This further vindicates the Greek conception of Sophia as absolute wisdom. Even when empirical representation runs its course, the &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; existence of a thing can never tell us the &lt;em&gt;enduring&lt;/em&gt; existence of a thing, unconstrained by spatio-temporality. It can only tell us what it is &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; and not what it was or what it will be. For those that require an explicit proof of what constitutes knowing of this kind (the kind which deals with what things are &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt;) as it relates to other forms of consciousness, like immediate sense certainty, I will refer to Georg W. F. Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and his &lt;em&gt;Attitudes of Thought to Objectivity&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopedia Logic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why this will be a point of departure is since the exploration that wisdom does cannot merely be re-presented or conveyed to another. This is meant in the same way that reading a manual for how to ride a bike, (even in all its intricacies and mechanics) does not mean we can ride a bike. In order for one to truly love wisdom, they must actually engage with it. One has to think and go through the impending developments themselves in order to grasp it. There is nothing tangible to represent it in the mind with in order to get it. This is not to be confused with the privileging of experiential knowledge above all other types. There is nothing exclusive in subjective experience that can be found in this exploration, seeing as it something universally accessible in character. Thought is something we use in our day to day. Why this coming exposition is difficult is because we do not leave the understanding. The understanding is the everyday idea of thought. It is the combination of representation and the claims of the relationship between a universal and particular. When it comes to representation, it is bundled up with what is sensible. At first the sensible makes its impression in experience, and thought first grasps this as a presentation of the sensible to our individual selves. Yet representation is bundled up with our &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; as what &lt;em&gt;re-presents&lt;/em&gt; itself to us. The distinction between representation and thought lies in the concept of representation itself— it &lt;em&gt;re-presents&lt;/em&gt; a given content of sensible material upon our experiential knowledge, whereas thought is what stands alone as independent of given material. We cannot use any unjustified material, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the very beginning since once again, it would not mean thought is self-developing. As it pertains to the claims between universal and particular, the understanding is only capable of making abstract and universal claims that connect a particular case with a universal principle. When confronted with a complexity beyond universal and particular, the understanding cannot make sense of it. Take for example the question of the circle. How many lines does a circle have? A line here is considered a &lt;em&gt;rectilinear&lt;/em&gt; line. Most people would answer none, since a circle is a curve that curves in on itself, in uniform fashion. Therefore, it cannot have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; lines. Understanding can only think in generalities, so as a result it understands straight and curved as the same, with &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; supplying both with formal meaning. There is a contradiction in terms here insofar as the concepts of straight and curved are mutually exclusive. Maybe you have come across a person that can only think in terms of generalities. This is the hallmark of the understanding. The understanding is the first of the three moments of all that is logically actual, overall named the speculative method. In all rigorous descriptions of the process of logic, you will find the understanding (abstraction) first, then dialectical reason, which is the negatively rational. Negative in the sense that it stands as opposed to something, rather than representing a polarity, which assumes many things we do not want to in an unprejudiced analysis. Finally, the speculative moment which serves an identical function to love as the moment which unifies all prior determinations as a further self-determination. When someone is considered a wise person (a person holding wisdom), they are considered to be sage-like holders of mystic wisdom that reveals the true nature of things. Mystic in modern day is a conflation of veiled and unknowable. But what is veiled can be unveiled as aletheia or truth, the act of unveiling. This process is undertaken by the speculative method. With the same etymology as specter, this speculative method is the spectral marriage of the Holy Spirit— of Christ and Sophia in us all. It is only for the understanding that the mystical appears unknowable. The understanding which only knows the abstract law of identity leaves thought alone as mystical and absolute. A minimal effort examination reveals that the understanding is not absolute. It is not the limit of our wisdom. Mystical knowledge very well should be known as speculative knowledge. The YouTube channel &lt;em&gt;Speculative Science&lt;/em&gt; has an exceptional &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/25mYl2g2NXk?si=L_dYhWQNRV1fOJV9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; discussing in-depth this method and what it entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have set the stage for thought, all that is left is to begin. “Begin with what?”, you might ask. Well, to begin with nothing in specific. Being. The first moment is to begin with the immediate beginning. Pure and abstract being. We begin with this pure being, since mediation is not possible. Mediation implies mediation by, which would immediately destroy the integrity of thought being thought. Objections to starting with any other starting point are self-defeating for this reason. So we must begin with pure being. Think about this being in terms of the most basic concept of God as the &lt;em&gt;containment&lt;/em&gt; of everything. In math terms, this would be the “set of all sets”. However, this moment of abstraction that the understanding provides us with runs into a problem when we try to determine what this thing we call pure being is. When trying to produce a principle from this immediate relation of pure being to itself, thought cannot produce any-thing. It produces no-thing. It then follows that this understanding of God the Absolute is nil. Without any determinate form, this understanding of God without form is without content. It does not tell you anything. What this does leave us with is another term alongside pure being. Nothing. When considering the structure of pure being, we have produced a relation to nothing. Oftentimes, this is where people that have not departed from wisdom overthink. In fact, it may be said that the entirety of thinking only in pure abstraction is an exercise in overthinking, for most. A process that is immediate has transpired thus far. Practice this now by thinking pure being. Not by thinking about a thing, but by thinking without any determination. What you produce is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is generally the principle of &lt;em&gt;śūnyatā&lt;/em&gt; in Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick note on nomenclature&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the matter under investigation is absolute in nature, it does not matter what names we use, since no such colloquial use is invoked by their usage. The terms chosen are chosen because they purport best to their colloquial counterpart and best describe the process going on, rather than drawing the content from this everyday usage into the determinations. Not only this, but it is the case that the terms selected are revealing of what their colloquial counterpart signifies. This creates a sense of familiarity with the person approaching logic and reveals a deeper understanding of the words people use in everyday language. It is for this reason that the terms are named what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to notice that a relation has been revealed between &lt;em&gt;pure being&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. When we try to determine what pure being is, we get nothing. However, it is a nothingness that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. The understanding has run its course and now dialectical reason unveils for us a negative relation wherein &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;pure being&lt;/em&gt;. Pure being is nothing, and nothing is pure being. They now take turns passing over into each other. The pure being we started with is &lt;em&gt;ceasing to be&lt;/em&gt; being and passing over into nothing. nothing in being instantiated is &lt;em&gt;coming-to-be&lt;/em&gt; a pure being. When people refer to &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, they are referring to the nothing, which is pure being. It is impossible to cognize nothing as &lt;em&gt;pure nothingness&lt;/em&gt;, since this nothing in being instantiated is &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now a system of terms that includes pure being and nothing. The system that results from their interaction stands as a new term we call becoming. Common &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; understands becoming as one swift movement unified in identity. But this becoming is not the product of the understanding’s abstract principle making, as it is not just the unity of [pure] being and nothing. Becoming is characterized by the encompassing of the inward unrest of the system. Becoming contains with it being as it ceases-to-be, and nothing as it comes-to-be. There are 4 terms: being, nothing, ceasing-to-be, and coming-to-be. The dialectical moment of being and nothing’s interactions with each other is sublated by the &lt;em&gt;speculative&lt;/em&gt; moment of unification. These moments of Being and Nothing, and ceasing-to-be and coming-to-be, now exist implicitly or &lt;em&gt;in-itself as becoming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it to become? What is &lt;em&gt;becoming&lt;/em&gt; becoming? In all cases, we understand what something becomes by understanding what it was and what it is. What it is, is the vanishing of being into nothing, and the vanishing of nothing into being. The contradiction of being being nothing, and nothing being being no longer holds, since they both have each other as moments of each other, and vanish into one another as becoming. Thus, what becoming is, is the relation of this immediate unity. Becoming is that which vanishes. It is as if becoming is the furnace by which the fires of being and nothing extinguish themselves and vanish, since it is in their nature to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming can then be described in the form of being, but not the pure being we started with. It is a being that has an immediate relation, and this relation is the prior unity of being and nothing. The term Hegel uses to distinguish this being from pure being is being-there, becoming in the form of being. In being-there, being and nothing have an immediate relation of negating or determining each other. So to give an account of what has transpired, the being of becoming, the being of what becoming has become, is known as being-there. This being-there in being itself is composed of an immediate relation of being and nothing negating or determining each other. The reason we do not determine any further on the level of being-there is because the nothing of becoming returns it to the being of becoming and thus becoming is being. Next, we take the being of being-there, what being-there is as such aka quality. So we move further and take being-there in the form of one of its moments, being. This is quality. quality is determinate being. When something has a quality, we mean that a thing has a determinacy that is immediate. Popcorn has the quality, or immediate determinacy, of being white, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality is then next to be determined from both sides. What follows from quality is the being and nothing (or non-being) of quality: Reality and Negation. This negation, or nothing, is not the empty and abstract nothing of the initial determinations of being and nothing, it is the determinate nothing that is implicit in quality. In the same way that nothing leads to being, this determinate nothing (Negation) leads to determinate being! What has essentially happened from the perspective of Reality and its other side Negation, is quality being reflected into both, determining both aspects of quality’s being and non-being, resulting in a determinate being once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This determinate being is not a return to the end of Becoming, but it is determinate being with the sublation of the entire process of determinations after the stated point within it. This type of being is now called being-in-itself. Something is the name given to this new determinate being’s being to differentiate it from quality. Something is the immediate determinacy of immediate determinacy, or the negation of the negation. Something is by virtue of a quality, which is a determinate being. Referring to some-thing is precisely what this implies. We call out a thing to give it distinction from a whole, or in other words, by negating it from a whole. The something is by being-there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something has within it all the prior determinations thus far. However, something faces a problem. First to be fully determined from all sides was becoming, being as negation aka being-there. Now it is Something, which is being-in-itself, or negation of negation. Something taken as such lacks concreteness, since it cannot use determinate being or determinate negation as a further development. However, it has not exhausted all its resources. Something can use becoming. Predictably so, not the becoming of pure being and nothing. But the becoming of determinate being and determinate nothing, which once again leads into determinate determinacy and subsequently into an Other something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, two things have been generated. One is something, and the other is an other thing. being taken as such, as being-in-itself produces for us nothing but the empty being of pure being. We have a richer form of being via the being of determinate being as something. At the same time that the being of determinate being is posited, so is the other side as negation. This negation of the richer being is known as limit, or restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes complete sense what is meant by limit in common parlance and in this manner. When we point out a something, we are pointing out a determinate thing that is, by virtue of its quality. A further exploration of something reveals it as partly being determined by what is other to it, not as a given content that stands opposed to something, but what has been generated as other from something. When you think of a pond or a lake, it is what it is by virtue of its quality (being water). But its limit is another generation of something’s being as the other side of being. The non-being of water in this case would be the land. In other words, the limit is the restriction of something through its other, as a determination of something. What we can describe this pond as is finite, since it is definite, e.g., has a limit. You can alter the size of the body of water (its quality), however it does not alter these determinations of something and other. Insofar as land is land in this scenario, as the other of the water, its limit or restriction is the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something is now determined as another. However, as other is itself a something, it too must become other. The two terms are stuck in an infinite loop, where something and other become other to themselves. We call this type of loop not becoming, but a negative or spurious infinity. The reason this is not infinity proper is that it is the finitude of each playing out forever. There is no reconciling the finite processes because they are turning into others indefinitely. This is an unending unrest. The solution does not lie in the purely negative either. You cannot define infinity by merely saying “the infinite is the non-finite”. Of course such a statement is obviously true, but it is as true as it is empty and devoid of meaning, considering it does not give you positive knowledge of infinity’s being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate to mention here the cowardice of those who claim that an idea of the infinite is beyond human comprehension. Instantiating an empirical model of spurious infinity might seem impressive to the misguided, but this firstly presupposes the idea of true infinity as spurious infinity. Secondly, it displays a key fact of the limit in its cognition. As Hegel says, “The very fact that something is determined as a limitation implies that the limitation is already transcended”. It is impossible to put something in mind that’s character cannot be fully comprehended by thought. It is a blatant contradiction to say that you are limited in thought by something only graspable in thought. How did you put it in mind in the first place? It is not of an inferential kind that one can guess the contours of the object of consciousness. The very grasping of these contours are direct determinations of the object itself. The only objection is the presupposed assertion that the indefinite instantiation of an empirical spurious infinity, is what is meant by ‘graspable in thought’. Since you cannot view a never ending highway for example, it is impossible to think infinity! Once again, this notion of infinity being infinity proper as well as the defects of empirical knowledge have been addressed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how then do we solve the problem of spurious infinity? It comes with the realization that something in its relation to other is already an other. It is the other of the initial other. The reconciliation here lies in the fact that what something turns into, is what it always was. It was the other in spurious infinity, but a further examination of its relationship to other reveals that what something as other passed into was other. It merely passed over into itself. Likewise, the other became other to other. What is other to other? Something. This reconciliation is true infinity. Both terms have been reconciled and now are not foreign, or other, to themselves. We have started with something, and ended up with something as determined by itself and not as other. The being we have now is a richer being called being-for-itself, as opposed to the being of the prior sphere as being-for-other. External determination and unfreedom has been avoided through an immanent development using only tools belonging to thought itself. Aptly called being-for-itself, it is a being which has no other to it. It is being as a further negation of negation. This is the composition of true Infinity. The process can go further, and does in Hegel’s Science of Logic. Even so, this is enough to understand the infinity before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infinity is the development of all things as they are, according to themselves. Everything is freely becoming itself, even as it seems it is coming to an end. The seed of an apple contains within itself the germ of the apple tree so that it can sprout the apple once more. Life contains within it the germ of death and reconciles it such that life produces itself again. This is the importance of true infinity, it is the description of freedom that exists freely everywhere. This notion of freedom as self-determination is known intimately in common consciousness as well. It is the implicit drive behind the concern against contradiction. Some may mistake contradiction itself as a sin against contentless formality, a violation of rigid and empty rules. But as a matter of fact, if existence were to be formalized, what the formalization would convey is that reality is static. We know this is wrong since there is flux not only between things, but within a thing itself. Therefore, the issue with contradiction goes beyond mere rule-breaking or hypocrisy. It points to the priorly stated unity between what a thing is conceptually and what it is in actuality, highlighting its incongruence. It is calling to attention that a thing is not what it is and that this is not the state of how things should be. Contradiction is then mistaken as the issue, when reconciliation is possible and even necessary. For example, we do not (or should not) condemn a marriage between two people if they have marital problems. We say that they need to work through their problems and arguments, given these problems are not threats to each individual’s well-being. In any case, the condemnation of contradiction is misguided, unproductive, and denies the dynamic aspect of things as they constantly become themselves, even if this becoming involves a contradictory aspect. The moment of true infinity is likewise this reconciliation of something’s inner contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what way would infinity be infinite if in confronting the finite it merely negated it? What this line of thought results in is infinity becoming the other of the finite, and losing its own positive content in the process. It lowers infinity to finitude by placing it alongside finitude as its negation. Infinity is also not a separate being that stands above the finite. The finite is subsumed under infinity in a way which recognizes their interconnectedness but still privileges infinity as this overcoming. Finitude within infinity is an ideal moment in this process of overcoming, since its meaning is in reference to infinity as it is subsumed under and transformed by the infinite. Ideality is the final determination to be introduced here as the truth of reality. This formulation of infinity as ideality is not only the basis of all subsequent and true philosophy, moving beyond the dogmatic monism and dualism which preceded it, but the formulation which reveals the dynamic and interconnected character of all concepts. Everything is becoming ideal. Correspondingly, the paradise in Herman Melville’s story exhibits this folly of standing above the worldly. Paradise in that context neglected any connection it had to reality, or the worldly. To be paradise proper it must subsume the finite worldly, as a moment of Heaven, the infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell is to be banished from humanity. What is cast (or casts itself) into hell is not a man: it is “remains.” To be a complete man means to have the passions obedient to the will and the will offered to God: to have been a man – to be an ex-man or “damned ghost”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;—C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, with all concepts and determinations explained here, the notion of Heaven we will explore is familiar yet foreign. Heaven is the home of God, and in many cultures refers to the sky above. It stands vis-à-vis infinity as one and the same. Where you find ideality, or perfection, you find God. By extension, God is everywhere there is love as the perfect union. It does not matter if it is the union of a concept with its object as it becomes itself, or with the union of complementary aspects such as man and woman or Christos and Sophia. This perfection is where God as absolutely perfect makes themselves at home. The reference to the sky is a reference to the ideal— the infinite sky, stars, and sun which subsume the finite Earth. Union with the absolute is Heaven, and we find this wherever there is true union. The ending of CS Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe series has this exact conception of Heaven. Apologies for the spoiler, but you have had around 70 years to read it. For those unfamiliar, it is a story set against the backdrop of World War II in which four siblings discover a magical wardrobe that transports them to a land called Narnia. There they encounter a powerful lion named Aslan (who is a metaphor for Jesus and is explicitly stated to be) and the evil White Witch as they battle for the soul of Narnia. Following the victorious final battle, Aslan (Jesus) takes them from Narnia into a place that seems like Narnia but is different. This land is called Aslan’s country. It is like Narnia but much grander and magnificent. Aslan’s Country is visible from Narnia, however it is separate. Within Aslan’s Country, there are mountains 80 times taller than ones on Earth, the greens are vibrant greens, and everything seems to be itself and more. It is as if this Narnia is a Narnia, more Narnia than Narnia. Seeing as Jesus led them to this land, this is an allegory for the fight against evil and their reward as salvation: access into heaven. It is not surprising then to realize that the entirety of the series is an allegory for the bible, from the fall of man till the New Testament. Narnia is Earth, Aslan is Jesus, and Aslan’s Country is Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis did not independently arrive at this conception of Heaven. While he has been influenced by a myriad of noteworthy theologians, authors, and poets like Dante, Swedenborg, and Milton, the version of Heaven that sits as the capstone of Narnia, is the same one revealed to John in Revelation. The context for revelation is this: On the island of Patmos, where he was exiled for spreading the word of Jesus, John the Apostle received a divine vision. This vision granted him a glimpse into the future, revealing the end of days on Earth and an extraordinary glimpse of heaven. What is of key importance in this vision is Jerusalem descending onto the ruins of the old Earth to stand as the Kingdom of God and his people on the new Earth. What replaced Earth was not an imposition of Heaven as the negation of Earth, but the rejuvenation of the Earth as what it was always meant to be. It is the same Earth that was destroyed, only now being the grounds for where God finds himself at home. Worth noting, and a common mistake people make, is that the name of the book is Revelation, not Revelations. It is singular and not plural. Perhaps the single revelation worth dedicating a book to is the revelation of salvation and the way into paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All talk of Heaven and none of hell would make me a hypocrite if I preach the error of one-sided determination. Hell in general terms would be that principle of division which opposes the process of self-determination. Its existence is a parasitic one on the good of infinite heaven, much like falsity is parasitic on the truth. Without truth, determinations of falsity cannot be made. Without Heaven, the state of all things in perfect unity with what they are meant to be, hell cannot have an existence. It would have nothing to oppose itself to. If they were to stand alone, these parasites of falsity and hell would destroy themselves. When someone is living through hell, they are going through a moment in which what constitutes them as who they are is being deprived of them. Perhaps this manifests as the lack of resources to make concrete or actual their existence as human. Maybe they are going through an addiction. Or this can take the form of mass atrocities or genocide. This is a living hell without a doubt. But this existence of being enslaved to other-determination is not what it means to live freely as an individual. It will, in the long run, succumb to truth. Even in cases where a loved one has passed away or you and a significant other have broken up, it may feel like hell. And it is. But they still live on as the influences carved in your heart for better or for worse, as a premise of your continued freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This self-determination as a certainty is not the imposition of us, as if we were slaves to it. Only with our permission can we turn towards the becoming of absolute unity. While the saying “God only helps those who help themselves” is stated in terms of a self-help proverb, it represents a necessary step in self-determination. This step is the step which is the groundwork for all further unity. We are not slaves to Sophia or thought either. We can choose to do foolish things after convincing ourselves that it is the right thing to do. Oftentimes, people decide to be slaves to an other-determination. To go against this self-determination is to willingly choose hell. In choosing not to correspond with concepts, this willed gap between you as a living human with what it means to be human is hell. Selecting a life of substance abuse is a disservice to what it means to live as a free individual. The autonomy here is in service of other, as the other of your own autonomy. Not autonomy, as it is free to be itself. Even if substance abuse is an escape from the hell of the world, it is an escape only in fleeing, and thus circles back to being determined by this the real world hell you are fleeing from. This form of escapism mirrors once more the Paradise of the Bachelors who mistake the negation of finitude as infinity, not realizing that the infinite is that which subsumes it. Truly, if one has convinced themselves that rebelling against freedom and self-determination is what constitutes their own freedom, you cannot convince them otherwise. You can only plant the seeds of doubt so that they may come to a free position themselves. They have the final say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it seems given the choice between total unity with the absolute and with a disconnectedness that is ultimately temporary seeing as this disconnectedness is self-destruction, that people would jump on the former. Yet it is not that simple for the reason stated. People willingly choose hell because they do not see Heaven as desirable. Stuck with the branding of worldly matters, to rise beyond these matters translates to disposing of what seems to be their purpose. This can be a difficult endeavor if it is all you know. For this reason, people in abusive relationships struggle to exit them. When exiting them, they find the norms of a true relationship foreign and unfamiliar. This urges them to return to what they are comfortable with, and urges them to re-establish their attachment to finitude. This self-destructive relationship is not only applicable to romantic relationships, but with the relationships we have connecting ourselves and all things. It is through the love of Sophia that we can recognize Heaven, this state of unfamiliarity, as the familiar extension of what we are and what we always were. This is the prime directive of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Evil is the gaze itself which perceives evil everywhere around it”&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;—Slavoj Žižek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophy is ultimately not a tool for the realization of a given end. It is the very realization that everything is in itself an ends for itself. The gaze of philosophy is the gaze of all unity. If one sees evil everywhere, it means they are blind to the good in which evil leeches off of. Thus, they see this lack of good in everything. The alternative is true for this phrase as well. When one sees things as they are, they see things as they are in unity with themselves, and therefore they see unity as such. The eye that sees what things are in perfect unity sees Heaven on Earth— they see the Kingdom of God in everything, since God&amp;rsquo;s domain is &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to Narnia, this eye sees how waterfalls are truly waterfalls, how the sky is the sky, and how the ocean is truly the ocean. It is to see and comprehend what was always there as galvanized by the light of wisdom. This is the light of the Kingdom of Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all Kings and Queens capable of reigning in this Kingdom, ruling in such a way that nothing changes according to our subjective will, but everything changes in accordance with God’s will. This will is the thread that weaves all things together and repeals what we assume things must be with what we know they are. Paradise Lost is thus the fall of man and the loss of innocence as the exposure and binding to the finitude of subjectivism and worldly matters. Man has been led astray by the slavery and unfreedom of external-determination, placing him in Tartarus. However, a return to what has been lost in this fall is possible and necessary for the re-establishment of our original unity. When Christ said to become like children if we want to enter the kingdom of heaven, he is not telling us to return to an impressionable state. This would cause a fall all over again. Christ means for us to return to this state not with the empty being we started with, but with a richer being as an innocence, that subsumes impressionability as a moment of its own. It is innocence that returns to itself after sanctioning impurity. Let us not take the path of the emperor, in the &lt;em&gt;Emperor’s New Clothes&lt;/em&gt;. The emperor, who was tricked by con-men into buying spectacular “invisible clothes” that were only invisible to the foolish. The subjects he rules under accepted this as the truth for fear of looking foolish. However, it is only when a child, who holds unprejudiced thought, points out that the emperor is wearing no clothes that the townsfolk realize what has been in front of them all along. Parading around with his invisible “clothes” even after this revelation is the fallen state we find ourselves in today. These new clothes are the foreign character of external-determination, which leaves us vulnerable and cloaks us from entry into the Kingdom of Heaven. We are not stuck in this Tartarus as a result of paradise lost, wearing the invisible clothes of the emperor. The possibility of salvation is within us all and always has been. Shall we parade around the world, naked and willfully ignorant? Or shall we throw off these “clothes” that bind us, for entry into paradise?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pragmatism and the Precept: Focus on the Concrete Through William James</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/pragmatism-and-the-precept-focus-on-the-concrete-through-william-james/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/pragmatism-and-the-precept-focus-on-the-concrete-through-william-james/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Thomas_Eakins%2C_American_-_Portrait_of_Dr._Samuel_D._Gross_%28The_Gross_Clinic%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Pragmatism and the Precept: Focus on the Concrete Through William James" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In short, the notion that real contingency and ambiguity may be features of the real world is a perfectly unimpeachable hypothesis. Only in such a world can moral judgments have a claim to be.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;—William James, &lt;em&gt;On Hegelisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;William James lived during a time of upheaval. A confluence of forces found in the Civil War, the rise of industrialism, a challenge of Darwinianism to old forms of seemingly dogmatic faith, and waves of new immigration situated him at the crossroads of science, religion, and philosophy. This portrayed him as a therapeutic thinker whose central mission was to make sense of these competing worldviews that troubled individual minds and the culture at large. He was, after all, America’s most influential philosopher at one point in time. Reflected in his thought is an American experience; his leading significance is in a “pragmatism” best fit for a young, pluralistic, action-orientated demos. James’s pragmatism offered a faith which rejected the absolute pessimism or optimism offered previously in favor of the belief that the world is changeable for the &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; through human effort. Specifically, that in the face of totalizing worldviews, the actual existence of evil and ambiguity is an integral part of what makes faith significant in the first place. He also provided a philosophy which opposed rigid, “monolithic” systems of thought. Embracing a “pluralistic universe” where multiple perspectives could coexist (as long as they cashed out in practical benefits), this mirrored the American ideal (if not always the practice) of integrating diverse peoples and ideas into a New Atlantis. Conceived of this way, James can be said to have been a key architect of a distinctively American culture of thought. He championed an intellectual style which was accessible, grounded in the concrete modes of life, and deliberately spoke to a broad public sociality. Philosophy for him was framed as a vital set of tools for addressing life’s concrete problems, as opposed to a technical puzzle for specialists, or in other words, philosophy is “what works” for individuals and society in navigating a world which they face. His ideas were what in part became embedded in America’s conscious self-conception, from progressive education, to the experimental ethos of the New Deal, to literature. All in all, he is the defining philosopher of American spirit during America’s transition to modernity. Therefore, James’s pragmatism is not to be understood as &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a theory of truth, but as a therapeutic tool for a particular America in the past which opposed any perceived imposition - be it dogmatic religion, scientific materialism, or the Absolute Idealism of Hegel - that neglected the concrete, immediate ‘precepts’ of being, in favor of abstract, totalizing explanations. His entire philosophy can be seen as a project to rescue and vindicate the “given” percept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission to rescue the precept surely wasn’t an abstract academic choice for James (as it would be contrary to his philosophy of pragmatism), it was an outgrowth of a personal history encountered in the neglected given itself. Two foundational experiences were what compelled his project to take the shape that it did. The first is a Swedenborgian upbringing that treated spiritual reality as a concrete fact. The second is a mystical encounter under nitrous oxide that delivered an overwhelming “tremendously exciting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination” where “every opposition&amp;hellip; vanished in a higher unity” and “the ego and its objects&amp;hellip; are one”. Considering he was the son of a devout &lt;em&gt;follower&lt;/em&gt; of Emanuel Swedenborg, Henry James Sr., familial inheritance can also be included in the former. Swedenborg presented his visions as detailed empirical reports; a descriptive science of the afterlife, angelic societies, and the correspondence between spiritual and natural laws. Growing up in this environment, it lends one to treat spiritual reality as a concrete dimension of experience to be investigated and described, and the attitude which incites an aversion to systems that would dismiss certain phenomena as an illusion. Thus, his later philosophical mission to expand empiricism to its radical limits, embracing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that is experienced, can be seen as a secularization and philosophic grounding of a Swedenborgian sensibility absorbed in youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal experimentation with nitrous oxide inspired an illumination in him, not unlike those who, in modern day, who take psychedelics and come away with some or other profound realization of the world. The most fundamental oppositions of subject and object, self and the world, and thinking and being dissolved in a “higher unity” as a direct overwhelming precept of unity- a raw, undeniable feeling of coalescence that was beamed right into his consciousness. For a committed empiricist and &lt;em&gt;critic&lt;/em&gt; of Hegelianism, this was a disorientating event. It presented a brute &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; of experience that his existing intellectual systems could not explain away. Such an experience became the test case for his emerging philosophy in asking, “how could thought do justice to such a powerful, noetic, yet at the same time transient and ineffable moment of experienced being?”. His entire project in &lt;em&gt;The Varieties of Religious Experience&lt;/em&gt; and the development of Radical Empiricism can be read as an attempt to build a philosophical system which can accommodate this kind of pre and post [Hegelian] conceptual revelation without reducing it in some way to either pathology, some lower order of something purely logical, or dismissing it outright as nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His commitment to the concrete precept led James into the dimly lit parlors of parapsychological research. Active participation in seances and his foundational role in establishing the American Society for Psychical Research are the rational extension of his radical empiricism, despite what some might claim. For James, reports of telepathy, clairvoyance, mediumship, etc. were empirical claims about the human experience which demanded rigorous investigation. Even famously studying the medium Leonora Piper for years, becoming convinced that certain phenomena, particularly telepathy, pointed to genuine, if poorly understood, connections between minds that transcended the ordinary channels of sense, he went as far as to claim that the future will corroborate the existence of telepathy. This work exemplifies a core philosophical courage in following the data of experience wherever it leads, even to the fringes of accepted science, and to defend the integrity of the precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Another famous figure associated with therapy also did research on telepathy: Sigmund Freud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="primacy"&gt;Primacy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established James’s life and experience and briefly giving an overview of his pragmatism, we can now begin to describe the novelty of his view. Often grounded under the banner of “pragmatism”, James’s system (which is more accurately termed Radical Empiricism) diverges from the “pragmatism” of his peers. For Charles Sanders Peirce, the founder of pragmatism, or pragmaticism, as he later called it, the meaning of a concept lay in the conceivable practical effects of its object, a rule for clarifying thought and inquiry within a community of scientists. The focus of Peirce was in formal logic and semiotics, depriving truth of its grounding and placing it onto the opinion of an infinite scientific community. Later, positivistic interpretations would reduce pragmatism to the embarrassing “verification principle”, where “what works” is synonymous with “what is empirically measurable”. However, for James, pragmatism was never simply a theory of meaning or a handmaiden to laboratory science. &lt;em&gt;His&lt;/em&gt; pragmatism was the servant of the full stream of immediate experience. The “practical” and “what works” is judged in the far more expansive criterion of a belief or concept being validated by its ability to do justice to and enrich the content put forth to consciousness. Does a belief in free will, in the spiritual significance of a mystical event, or in the moral texture of the universe help an individual connect more vitally, act more courageously, and make richer sense of the palpable, “jolting” quality of life? If so, it has pragmatic truth. Consequently, where other pragmatisms might dismiss religious or moral experiences as subjective epiphenomena, James’s radical empiricism demanded that they be included as constitutive parts of the world to be explained. At core, James’s philosophy of pragmatism is the defense of the dignity and ontological weight of the precept, known as raw and indeterminate observed being, against any system that would reduce or exclude it. This commitment finds its completion in his critique of Hegelianism (or rather the Hegelians of his day). James readily acknowledged the shared philosophical desire to show that the ideal is real, his objection was to the methodological violence perceived in Hegel’s system. The actual delivery of reality to consciousness is not a smooth, logical emanation, but something far more primal and disruptive. “The parts seem, as Hegel has said, to be &lt;em&gt;shot out of a pistol at us&lt;/em&gt;”, James writes. “Arbitrary, foreign, jolting, discontinuous—are the adjectives by which we are tempted to describe it.” This “jolt” is the hallmark of the pure precept, the unmediated givenness of things before the intellect goes to work. Hegelianism, for James, in achieving its elegant and totalizing rationality, must “butcher” a great part of the world’s contents, forcibly relegating the qualitative richness of immediate experience to the dust-bin labelled Maya, only to be subjugated to the Hegelian Concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the crux of James’s departure from what he would term “monolithic” idealism. He does not deny the human drive for unity or ideal comprehension, instead insisting that such unity must be &lt;em&gt;discovered within&lt;/em&gt; the concrete floe of relations between percepts, rather than being imposed upon them by a logical schema. The ideal for him is the connective tissue found in the “great continua” of space, time, and personal consciousness that provide a “common table” for the world&amp;rsquo;s diverse elements. This leads to his famous pluralistic metaphor: The universe is not an Absolute, but a “Republican Banquet” where the myriad “qualities of being respect one another&amp;rsquo;s personal sacredness” while partaking in shared relations. In this model, the precept retains its “sacred” integrity. James&amp;rsquo;s pragmatism then is the tool to navigate a precept-laden world, making it work for man. It is a pragmatism where truth successfully connects one percept to another within the spectacle of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-precepts-destiny"&gt;The Precept’s Destiny
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;James’s critique of Hegelianism correctly identifies the violence of a philosophy that, in its drive for total thinking immanence and coherence, must dissolve the immediate, indeterminate data of consciousness as a moment of logical system. In defending this realm, James performs the invaluable service of forcing philosophy to contend with the primacy of the percept, the unmediated encounter that is the necessary starting point for all knowledge, and what all systems of knowledge must confront. Rightly protesting against a rationalism that would dismiss the concrete, qualitative being of the world, as an overcoming by some higher logic or principle, his rebellion is justified and essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for all its rebellious power, this pragmatism inverts the Hegelian “neglect” and fails to provide an account of the very precept it seeks to defend by asserting the primacy of the precept over the concept. By situating the percept’s validity within a pluralistic psychological economy of what “works” for the individual, he inadvertently reduces it. In his system, the percept is a terminal point; it is a brute and opaque fact whose meaning is determined by its subsequent utility in the stream of subjective experience. While its reality is confirmed by moral and practical value, its intrinsic ontological significance remains less than unexplored. It is externally-determined and unfree. The flaw of this perspective sees that precept and concept are not two independent entities, one is primary, and one is secondary. They are inseparable poles of a unified generative/creative act. The concept is not applied to the precept from the outside. It is the active inward force through which the percept’s latent meaning is awakened and realized. Green is not intelligible as “foliage” because of a practical association, it becomes intelligible because the spiritual activity of thinking actively brings the idea of the plant into relationship with the sensory impression; in the act of thought, concepts are arrived at and realized as the unifying principle which brings coherence to a manifold of sense impression. Therefore, James is right that Hegel’s system, in its majestic sweep, can trample the particularity of the precept. But he is wrong to believe the precept can stand alone as self-sufficient. By making the precept primary, he leaves it fundamentally unintelligible on its own terms. He defends its existence, but at the same time severs it from the very power that gives it meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a final note, the defining truth of William James lies in his unshakeable commitment to an expansive reality. James’s radical empiricism performs the essential work of shattering the idealist philosopher’s veto on what constitutes legitimate experience. By insisting that the full spectrum of the “given” - including but not limited to moral urgency, telepathy, and sense perception - he establishes the &lt;em&gt;percept&lt;/em&gt; in all its varieties as philosophically inviolable. There is a transformation of the immediate, indeterminate &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; of the world brought to consciousness from a problem to be solved, into a mandate for any true ontology to actually confront and connect with on unbiased terms. This radical empiricism finds a strong alliance with the &lt;em&gt;precept&lt;/em&gt; of Steiner, who asserts that the immediate presentation of the world, whether it be in a leaf, or a thought, is not an illusion to be explained away by the mineralistic and natural sciences, but the content of which is the starting point of true knowledge of things. The concrete, then, is not physical. It is the total, rich content of encounter, before it is infringed upon by theory. It is quite admirable that the pragmatic insistence on the concrete is not entirely wrong to the extent that it honors the sovereignty of the “moment of truth”. What any given thing is supposed to do is found in its concrete being-in-the-world. Any declared intention or pre-existing theory is washed away by a radical fidelity to the observable fact of the matter, and in fact this “fact” is proof of the concept in question. Likewise, the precept is the output of a deeper ideality or system, and in order to understand that system (whether it is the thinking of Nature, or the thinking of Spirit), an indispensability of the output must be established. The defense of such a moment takes the form of a foundational element of the American philosophic character; William James is the pragmatic spirit insistent on the authority of the concrete, and oriented toward truths borne of action and proven on their own merits. Therefore, the significance to be extracted from James is in the imperative which seeks comprehension by first humbling oneself towards what is given, for only then does one earn the right to speak on the truth of a matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief view of the UN General Assembly might suggest a world of formally equal sovereign units. The reality of the situation is that the architecture of 21st century power reveals a different hierarchy altogether. Global politics is increasingly dominated by the moves of a few big players, namely the US, China, Russia, Iran, and the EU as a collective unity. What distinguishes these poles is not the economic weight or military, although these should not be ignored, it is their continental &lt;em&gt;scale&lt;/em&gt; and cultural depth. They operate as integrated civilizational spheres, commanding vast-stretching internal markets and strategic hinterlands which transcend simple national borders. Beneath this appearance, the condition of even prospering smaller states appears with vulnerabilities. Nations like Estonia, Singapore, or Chile, which are celebrated as agile models of liberal democracies or economic miracles (although a few questions problematize this depiction. Economic growth for &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt;? Liberal democracy in what sense? Singapore is a technocratic bourgeois state managing labor for capital efficiency, contingent on being a strategic port embedded in global finance and logistics networks, and a beneficiary of Cold War geopolitics. Chile is an experiment in neoliberalism under U.S. backed dictatorship, integrated and benefiting from the IMF and World Bank, with a Post-Pinochet landscape finding privatized pensions, education, and water, extreme wealth concentration etc. The “transition” to democracy preserved neoliberal relations, and in no sense was it democratic. Estonia is a laughable example of success, they are a peripheral experiment rather than a sovereign node in the world. Capital here is guaranteed by EU/NATO integration with a brain drain exporting labor to the “imperial core”, so in no sense is this agility replicable. These countries are, in effect, successful for capital on the one hand, and used to discipline other societies on the other) grapple with pervasive insecurities. Their economies are sensitive to global changes in finance, be it supply chains or investments. Their digital infrastructures are continuously exposed to cyber campaigns that can emanate from state actors with resources orders of magnitude larger. Their security is contingent on alliances that constrain autonomous action. Their domestic cultural markets are inundated by the platform ecosystems and media outputs of the great blocs aforementioned. Sovereignty, for them, is increasingly a negotiation contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift is mirrored in a rhetorical evolution. The language of international relations is slowly but surely transitioning away from the discrete calculus of national interest, to the grander defense of holistic ways of life and world orders. We hear of the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, grounded in more than 5,000 years of civilization. We hear of the Russian World (&lt;em&gt;Russkiy Mir&lt;/em&gt;), similarly bound in a common history and Orthodox tradition. Of a free and Open Indo-Pacific, which is responsible for upholding a particular liberal narrative. Even the once universalist “West” now functions in a discourse as a distinct civilizational faction facing challengers and outsiders: read more on that &lt;a class="link" href="https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/on-shithole-countries-and-the-degeneracy-of-america-the-chickens-have-come-home-to-roost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What this change in language signifies is a conceptual shift where politics is being framed from the competition of countries, into organizing visions of society and historical meaning. Of these concurrent trends, whether it is the aggregation of power into huge blocs, the pressure on smaller states, or the reflective turn in political rhetoric, the situation at hand prompts a question regarding the structure of the state. In order to answer this question, an elaboration on what the “state”, and waving away it’s equation with “nation-state” is necessary. The latter is not the default setting of political organization, nor has it been historically. It is a relatively recent phenomena. We can distinguish between two types of states for the purposes of this essay: the Nation-State and the Civilizational-State, with the 20th century ideological super-state (emphasized by the communist project) revealing of a novel particularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="modern-forms-of-state"&gt;Modern Forms of State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation-state’s (hereby referred to as nation) core principle is the claimed congruence of political sovereignty with a homogenous national identity. This identity can be rooted in &lt;em&gt;ethnos&lt;/em&gt; (shared ethnicity, language, descent) or &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; (a civic persuasion of shared laws and participation), but the logic remains one of singularity. The internal process is unification, assimilation, and the active creation (often through standardized education or propaganda, or conscript armies, etc.) of a singular people within defined borders. It’s highly important to note that this form is a historic novelty. It is a product of post-Westphalian Europe, perfected via 19th century romantic nationalism (e.g.; Germany’s unification under Prussian leadership, or France’s Jacobin project of turning peasants into Frenchmen). The global proliferation of this form was a function of colonialism and coercion. As European imperial powers operated as nation-states at home, they imposed the Westphalian state system on their colonies, carving arbitrary borders that ignored indigenous political and cultural distinctions. Upon independence, these new states were forced to adopt the nation-state template to participate in the international order. This process was, and still is, reactionary and inherently violent, requiring the top-down construction of a national mythos often from disparate ethnic groups, which can be considered a kind of internal colonization necessary to compete in a system they did not create. France (post-1789) and Germany (post-1871) stand as the perfect examples of nation-states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In construct stands the civilizational state. The core principle of this form is the alignment of sovereignty with a self-contained civilization. Meaning and organic meta-culture that encompasses and hierarchically orders multiple ethnicities, languages, and regional identities. The unity here derives from an integration under a dominant civilizational core, defined by a shared foundational mythos, philosophic worldview, and a sense of historical continuity within some broader project. The internal logic here is not the assimilation into &lt;em&gt;sameness&lt;/em&gt;, but the management of plurality under a central political authority which acts as the guardian of a perennial civilizational order. Pre-modern China is the best example here, operating under the Mandate of Heaven (Tianxia) as a civilization which cognized itself as the world, governing a vast expanse through “meritocratic” bureaucratic elitism (such as the Confucian exam system), as opposed to ethnic Han primacy. Tsarist Russia similarly expanded as a multi-ethnic, Orthodoxy-led empire. The Ottoman Empire organized itself around Islamic law and the Sultanate, as opposed to the Turkish ethnicity alone. These polities are defined by their scale, absorptive capacity, and self-conception as unique, enduring universalities (and likewise individualities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20th century introduced a disruptive necessity as a reaction to modernity. We may call it the “ideological superstate”. This model explicitly rejected both the ethnic nationalism of the nation, and the traditional civilizational hierarchies of empires. Its core principle was an ideological universality which put ethnicity lower on the totem pole (and in some cases can be considered post-ethnic, however this possessing morphological similarities to the civilization-state requires that it not dispense with ethnicity. It just doesn’t center ethnos as the unifying glue). Projects like the USSR and Maoist China aimed to dismantle traditional loyalties to clan, tribe, religion, and in some cases ethnicity, and replace them with a new, synthetic identity based on class consciousness and party discipline. The goal in the USSR is the “New Soviet Man”, a product of collective social engineering for the purposes of collectivization and industrialization. To view the USSR as a “Slavic” state or China purely as a “Han” state is a profound category error, projecting a nationalist framework onto a system designed to destroy that very framework. In these states, ethnicity was treated as a bourgeois relic to be superseded or a tactical administrative category (as in China’s &lt;em&gt;minzu&lt;/em&gt; system). Unity in this form is derived from ideology and shared participation by the collective sociality (and subsequently the productive machine). This represented a flawed, but ambitious attempt to leap beyond both previous forms into a purely modern, politically constructed totality, one that has shaped the entire world, and that we are still feeling the effects of. Its erosion and the subsequent search for new sources of legitimacy in Russia and China have directly prompted their conscious re-articulation as civilizational states today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communist states (aka ideological super-states) failed as enduring political forms for internal reasons and historical pressures. The core failure can be described as a tension between universalist ideology and the persistent particularity of being. The project of erasing bourgeois relations found in ethnicity, religion, or kinship, and replace them with class consciousness proved to be a project which people resisted. The state demanded an abstract loyalty to a future goal, but could not permanently supplant deeper, pre-existing civilizational and ethnic identities, which it was often forced to administratively manage. The responsibility for this project seemed better to fit the state itself, while being replicated and echoed by subjects. Furthermore, the models&amp;rsquo; legitimacy was somewhat brittle, hinging on continuous material delivery (and expansion which, surprise surprise, is not a feature of capitalist state forms but of all modern state forms) and ideological fervor being replicated in subjects. Unlike the nation, which could appeal to primordial ties (ideologically it is functionally primordial, otherwise the state would have to contend with its own mortality) or the civilization-state, which could invoke some continuity of tradition, the ideological super-state offered only a promised future of material abundance and historical vindication. When economic stagnation set in, and when the revolutionary fervor faded, the entire basis for loyalty and sacrifice evaporated. There was no fallback identity, only a disenchanted present, leading to a crisis of meaning and political cynicism that the system was unable to address (which may take the form of looking back fondly on the USSR or similar communist states for the problems they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; able* to solve). Finally, the super-state was ultimately vulnerable to the forces of globalization and informational exchange that its closed borders couldn’t withstand forever. The weakness of the “state” and the strength of the “Iron Curtain” were at odds, and when it fell, the global flow of capital, cultural products, and ideas in the late 20th century became an alternative and eroded the state’s monopoly on truth. Upon this erosion of the state,its constituent societies defaulted to more resilient sources of identity, reaching back to pre-ideological substrates of civilization or nation to fill the void left by the collapsed ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation does not fare any better. There are two converging axes which emerge as issues for the structure of the nation state. The first is the external return of a disruptive historical logic, and an internal contradiction in social cohesion. Externally, the nation is confronted by the long term consequences of its own colonial and imperial past. The model, being globalized through a process of violent imposition and social disassembly aborad, created extractive and fundamentally unfree political economies. The instability and displacement this engineered now recoils on the metropolitan cores in the form of demographic movements and the importation (which is really a manifestation of inner atomization. This will be explicated soon) of social atomization. States that derived cohesion from a myth of insular homogeneity must now manage the human outcomes of their own historical project of global disruption, challenging their capacity to maintain a unified national narrative. Internally, the nation suffers from a poverty of social ecology; a lack of a realized actual social substance. Whether grounded in ethnic sameness or civic creed, its promise is a unified “people”. Yet, neither basis reliably generates an enduring substrate required for sustained cohesion. Trust is not a passive product of shared identity, it is an active achievement forged through the mediated negotiation of difference within shared conditions. In this sense, the nation logically leads to liberal multiculturalism as a step above the immediate unity of sameness. Meaning a unity of peoples that are different, if it is a true unity, is a unity that finds its ground in something ideal, and has infinite integrity compared to a unity compared in natural contingency (such as being the same ethnicity as another). Unfortunately, the procedural frameworks of liberal nations, focused on abstract equality and recognition, often fail to facilitate this genuine negotiation, leaving material and social rifts unaddressed. When this happens, the purported national unity fragments, retreating into tribalisms and shallow consumer citizenship, thereby hollowing out the model’s legitimizing core from within. Thus, the nation-state is caught in a pincer movement. Pressured from without by the returning consequence of its historical actions, and fraying from within due to its inability to fulfill its foundational promise of authentic communal solidarity, this dual vulnerability points to a model approaching its functional limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-passing-away-of-the-nation-state-small-countries-dont-exist"&gt;The Passing-Away of the Nation State. Small Countries Don’t Exist!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Civilization-State stands alone as the enduring form of political governance, making a resurgence. The process of political forms is always a series of adaptation to conditions and a mirroring of the age. Likewise, the “conditioned” of the civilization-state form is scale. The integrated informational systems of modernity have rendered the classical sovereign nation an increasingly vulnerable anachronism. To compete, let alone secure itself and maintain cultural coherence, a political entity must now command continental resources, internal markets (in the form of having a governing body ultimately having the final say in market determination), and a civilizational identity (in addition to nukes, although this inclusion might upset some people. Nonetheless, it is true). These are the pressures increasingly conditioning towards a convergence to the civilizational state model, whether explicitly, or implicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standalone nation, particularly that of modest size, is being functionally hollowed out by a few pillars of modern power. Technology and security have been redefined. National defense is about cybersecurity, satellite networks, and intelligence (and increasingly about what is termed “artificial intelligence”). Sovereign capability in these domains requires immense capital, and large &lt;em&gt;proprietary&lt;/em&gt; pools of data for machine learning, and integrated, advancing industrial bases. These are resources that are simply inaccessible to smaller states, making them perpetually dependent on consumers in another power’s technological ecosystem. Additionally, economic resilience now demands a kind of internal diversity. The global market, while generating wealth, has created a systemic fragility where only political units with continent scale diversified economies (including &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; supply chains, natural resources, and consumer bases for the consumer market) can withstand economic volatility and coercion such as targeted sanctions. Smaller nations live in a state of perpetual exposure, with their stability contingent on the strategic calculus of larger blocs. Essentially what I’m saying is that small states &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; exist in an era where sufficient reach of technology, communication, and influence also exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, and a more subtle aspect, is that there is a battle for &lt;em&gt;cultural-informational&lt;/em&gt; sovereignty. The global “public square” is owned and operated by a handful of American and Chinese platform corporations. For a society to maintain control over its cultural narrative or political discourse (in modern societies, the digital common area is akin to the social fabric), it must have the capacity to regulate these foreign giants and potentially host alternative narratives. This is only feasible with a unified linguistic and cultural market numbering in the hundreds of millions &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; (don’t take this number literally, it is only to emphasize the scale). Without this scale, a nation’s digital psyche and markets are colonized by foreign algorithms designed for engagement, as opposed to social cohesion taking the form of supporting domestic markets and social wellbeing, inevitably eroding the shared identity that a given nation claims to protect (or even civilization-state, since what is described is a normative reality for any functioning state). Scale is a prerequisite for meaningful sovereignty in the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confronted by this situation, even the archetypal nations are being forced to adopt the logic and posture of civilization-states to retain relevance and sovereignty. Consider France, the Jacobin nation built on universal citizenship and the active assimilation of differences into a singular “Frenchness”. Today, it projects power &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; as a republic, but as a guardian of a Francophone civilizational sphere. Its rigid concept of &lt;em&gt;laïcité&lt;/em&gt; (secularism) is promoted as a universal model, while the French language is defended as a vessel for a distinct way of thought. Through the &lt;em&gt;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&lt;/em&gt;, France acts as a kind of decentralized metropole for a global community of French-speakers, in a way which transcends the concept of nationhood, and approaches the figure of civilizational patronage. One can also take the example of India, who is also undergoing a reconceptualization. Founded as a pluralist democracy, it is increasingly articulated under Hindutva ideology as “Bharat”, a civilizational state positing the Indian nation as the embodiment and homeland of a global Hindu civilization, seeking to integrate its internal diversity under this overarching cover. India’s framing of sovereignty is encroaching further and further into a stewardship of an ancient, enduring civilizational order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU can perhaps represent the most informative example, since it is the most explicit and deliberate political experiment. The EU represents the clearest admission that the classic European nation is no longer a viable unit- it is a post-national project aimed at constructing a new civilizational-scale polity by pooling economic, regulatory, and political sovereignty. It creates an abstract “European” identity based on shared regulations (as seen with the “Brussels Effect”), a continental market, and so on and so forth, positioned against other great civilizational blocs. It must be said that this form of unity is abstract, and so will not last forever. If I was a European, I would be a proponent of Kojeve’s “Latin Empire”, since there is actual cultural and traditional continuity to be drawn from in this case. Ironically, Kojeve was the architect of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some states adapt implicitly, others explicitly and ideologically reject the nation model, while consciously reviving the civilizational state form. China is a rather refined example. Its scholars and leadership explicitly describe it as a civilizational state, a political entity whose legitimacy and continuity span thousands of years beyond the modern emergence of the nation-state form. The state manages 56 officially recognized ethnic groups (&lt;em&gt;minzu&lt;/em&gt;) but within a framework of a unified, Han-civilizational core advanced by the Communist Party. It must be said that this civilizational core is not a regression into the commensurability of the nation form with an &lt;em&gt;ethnos&lt;/em&gt;, it is the recognition of an ethnogenesis. After all, the process of ethnogenesis in the very civilizational continuity China claims was left open. It would be moronic to claim that China is the “Han” people, if what is meant is that the success or definite essentiality of China as a state is reducible to the mere fact of repetition in natural contingency. Even China’s monumental foreign policy, the &lt;em&gt;Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/em&gt;, is framed as the restoration of ancient civilizational trade routes, rather than a sterilized “infrastructure investment”, in effect, tying its geopolitical ambition directly to the narrative of civilizational renaissance. Russia, having integrated and overcome the failed universalist ideology of Marxism-Leninism, has filled the void with &lt;em&gt;Eurasianist&lt;/em&gt; civilizationalism. This ideology posists Russia as a unique “Third Rome”, a distinct spiritual civilization rooted in Orthodoxy, autocratic tradition, and a multi-ethnic empire, standing apart from a decadent “Atlantacist” West. This self-conception directly frames its geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, not as interstate disputes, but as a civilizational struggle to defend its Russian World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States presents an ambiguous case. Domestically, it operates as the world’s most powerful civic nation-state, bound by the constitutional creed of “e pluribus unum”. Globally, it functions as a kind of liberal-universalist civilizational projector, exporting a package of socio-political norms not presented as American, but as universal values. This creates a de facto civilizational sphere (“the West”) but leads to perpetual tension between its particular natural interests and its proclaimed universal mission. The ambiguity is partially dispelled when one realizes that the social substance in America has functionally been overdetermined and captured by capital interests. Even in the political theater characterized by cultural antinomy, the system still does what it does; as much as Donald Trump, who is president at the time of writing, paints the narrative as a return to the civilizational centrality of America (which is left open-ended, and is thus, an empty advertisement slogan, which one again is a reflection of the interests of capital, and its nexus of propaganda — sorry, I meant “PR” firms), education will still be defunded, public libraries and public access information sources will slowly phase away, every aspect of life will be privatized, birthrates will lower, and so on and so forth. The question of America’s nation-state status is still quite a wonder, since the process of ethnogenesis has never reached its conclusion, aside from the fact that it is a perpetual process. There is no “American” people like there are Russian Slavs or Chinese Han. America has always been marked by waves of immigration, finding institutional representation in the various racial categories: the Black Belt in the South, the Latinos near the border and Western America, the various Native groups dotting the country, and the “Whites” throughout the country, who have given up their previously cultured lives in exchange for abstract unmanifested personhood. Enough about America, we will have plenty of time to analyze her in other articles and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis above necessitates the decisive clarification that only &lt;em&gt;European&lt;/em&gt;-derived states like France are “true” nation states in &lt;em&gt;origin&lt;/em&gt;. The form of the nation itself was the novel product of the European development, mirroring the emergence of the Consciousness Soul. It emerged from the Peace of Westphalia and was perfected by the modernizing states like France and Germany. This model was then violently grafted onto the rest of the world, with no regard for organic and indigenous political or cultural distinctions already present. Therefore, the current global crisis of the nation is deepest in post-colonial regions, where the form was always an ill-fitting imposition. Yet, as demonstrated, even its European birthplace is not immune. France today can only assert its sovereignty by operating within the larger, implied civilizational framework of “Western Europe” and the transatlantic alliance, leveraging a shared heritage of Greco-Roman philosophy (particularly Plato and Aristotle) and Christianity. Its national project is not nested within this broader &lt;em&gt;civilizational&lt;/em&gt; project, conclusively establishing that in the face of modernity’s demands, the political logic of the civilizational state has become an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Problem of Africa in German Idealism and Anthroposophy's Treatment as a Response to Afro-Pessimism</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-problem-of-africa-in-german-idealism-and-anthroposophys-treatment-as-a-response-to-afro-pessimism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-problem-of-africa-in-german-idealism-and-anthroposophys-treatment-as-a-response-to-afro-pessimism/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/1375_Atlas_Catalan_Abraham_Cresques.jpg/2560px-1375_Atlas_Catalan_Abraham_Cresques.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Problem of Africa in German Idealism and Anthroposophy's Treatment as a Response to Afro-Pessimism" /&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philosophy’s consideration is supposedly one which is both universally accessible, and universally accepting of contribution. There is an imperative for any valid domain that it be accessible to anyone regardless of background, and for this domain to relate back onto man, in such a way as to be receptive to the background of the contributing agent. As such, the question of how the domain of philosophy stands to exclude is not simply a sociological critique, but it itself a philosophical problem that strikes at its claim to truth, and it’s status as a valid domain. Nowhere is this problem more acute, or more personal for me as a thinker who happens to be African American, than in the tradition of German Idealism, and supposedly its indirect successor found in Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophy. In the works of Kant and Hegel, and in the spiritual-scientific system of Steiner, we find some of the most powerful frameworks ever conceived for understanding freedom, humanity, consciousness, etc. Frameworks that &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; aspire to universality and objectivity. Yet, embedded within these same works are characterizations of Africa and its people that range from apparent prejudiced ignorance to a placement “outside of History”. This creates quite a few seeming tensions, and conjured within me questions, which I have since reconciled, but wish for the reader to keep in mind in order to guide their own thinking and arrive at well-reasoned conclusions. Indeed, it only takes a few Google searches to come across the scathing words Kant and Hegel have had for an entire continent and groups of people. What differentiates them from their contemporaries, found in individuals like Linnaeus, if anything? How can such totalizing systems be so exclusionary? When we get to the more esoteric frameworks, such as with Anthroposophy, in what way are such thinkers (or in this case, “seers” perhaps) not essentializing the categories employed during their time and placing a kind of determinism upon individuals which are within categories? How are the individual and the particular group they belong to reconciled, what is that relationship? These questions go on and on, however the most important question guiding inquiry is this: how can one value the architecture of a system seemingly built, at least in part, with flawed and exclusionary materials? In other words, where do the descriptions of Africa, and this “race” of people (Africans), come from, and what does it stand to mean for the destiny of these people according to such philosophers and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contemporary philosophical movement of Afro-pessimism offers a stark and logical response. “One cannot value such systems” is essentially the insight of thinkers like Frank B. Wilderson III. The standpoint of Afro-pessimism (hereby referred to as AP) is that this &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; called blackness is not just excluded from, but is the constitutive outside against which Western concepts of “Humanity” and “Social Life” are defined. From this view, the problem of Africa in Kant, Hegel, and what appears to be Steiner is not an accidental flaw, but the revealing symptom of a structural antagonism. To seek inclusion or reclamation within their systems is, therefore, a kind of fundamental error. This article argues against that conclusion. What I propose is that the most rigorous response to this historical problem is not to discard these philosophical systems, but to engage in an immanent critique and subsequent reclamation, if appropriate. By carefully comprehending the claimed universal method of these thinkers and then appraising the claims they make, such as with Africa, one can correctly avoid “throwing out the baby with the bathwater”, as a matter of saying. If such contingent particularities of their historical consciousness exist and pervade their thought, we can successfully discover how, using their own logic, they themselves contain the resources for self-correction. Through an examination of Hegel’s claims, Steiner’s understanding of what “race” even is, and finally, the universal imperatives at the core of these projects, the solution does not lie in the aptly named pessimistic, self-destructive passivity of AP. If a solution exists, it exists within clarifying the universality these thinkers left behind as the inheritance of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="universal-systems-particular-blindness"&gt;Universal Systems, Particular Blindness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal aspirations of European philosophy from the colonial period (let us say from the 1600s to the 1800s) did not emerge in a vacuum. They were conceived in a world being reshaped by colonial conquest, slavery, resource extraction, and so on and so forth. These are all second-order, or for the philosophically minded, conditional factors. I don’t mean to invoke “material conditions”, since this would be making a very huge blunder in grounding necessity. Rather, I would like to place the necessity within the mode of consciousness which came to dominate the West. Colonialism is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the economic “machine”, it is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the expression of the intellectual current of the age, one which seeks to master the external world through abstraction, quantification, and mechanism, and to sever the human being from the living connection to its spiritual origins, and crystallize this spirit into a fixed logical system. This is the consciousness that built not only the steam engine and the stock market, but also the philosophical systems of Kant and Hegel. Kant’s critical philosophy, which aimed to find the universal laws of pure reason, and Hegel’s Absolute Idea, which comprehended reality as the logical system of Concept, are supreme intellectual achievements of this current. They represent the peak of mind&amp;rsquo;s capacity to create self-enclosed, rational universes. It’s therefore not a historical coincidence that this epoch of radical abstraction in thought coincided with the project of global abstraction in practice, otherwise known as colonialism. The same consciousness that reduced the world to categories and concept &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; reduced foreign lands to territories with qualities removed. Philosopher’s like John Locke, who theorized on property while helping draft the slave constitutions of Caroline, and John Stuart Mill, who defended liberty while administering the British Empire, were not hypocrites. They were thinkers whose insights into law, liberty, and individuality were shaped by, and in turn gave form to, this dominant, globalizing, and ultimately abstracting mode of consciousness. Their work reveals that the very concepts of modern Western freedom and universality were, from their inception, entangled with the logic of domination and exclusion required by the global system they helped to rationalize. This entanglement is evident not only in whom these philosophies excluded, but in the very conception of “individual” which was promoted. The subject afforded rights by Locke, or moral consideration by Kant (with a qualification we will get to) was a specific historical abstraction- this being the propertied, European male. This model of subjectivity was already a fiction, a selective elevation of one mode of being into a universal form. Yet, this fiction did not culminate in a true qualitative individuality universally. Nor would it be possible to rescue such a project, let alone aim to integrate into it. Instead, under the logic of the modern, abstracting consciousness they helped codify, the particular “Caucasian” subject has dissolved just as surely as the colonized “other”. What has emerged is not a universal qualitative individuality, but the quantified fungible unit. It is the interchangeable “man” of bureaucracy and markets, the “mass man” of José Ortega y Gasset, and the &lt;em&gt;One-Dimensional Man&lt;/em&gt; of Herbert Marcuse. Fundamentally, it is the unfree individual. The philosophical projects of Locke and the like thus contain a tension. Their abstractions point toward a universal humanity, yet their historical instantiation served a particular, exclusionary order. At best, this means their philosophies are on some level incomplete as a result of a contingent birth untranscended. At worst, it suggests that the logic of abstraction, of the modernity which they contain, has in it from the very beginning a reduction of the human to a manageable quantity. This is the very possibility that enables both the rationalized “liberty” of the citizen and the rationalized exploitation of the colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel Kant’s work presents such a striking internal conflict between his groundbreaking universal ethics via the Categorical Imperative, and his own deeply held prejudices. In his writings &lt;em&gt;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Groundwork of Metaphysics of Morals&lt;/em&gt;, Kant writes, for instance, that the “Negroes of Africa” had received “by nature no feeling that rises above the trifling”. He goes so far as to tie moral character with biology, providing pseudo-scientific justifications for purported suitability for servitude. This was certainly not a marginal aside. It can be read rightly as a systematic attempt to ground human difference in natural law, directly contradicting the core principle he would later establish as the foundation of morality: that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; rational being possesses an incalculable worth as an end in itself, as noumena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let it be known that this schema was not left unchallenged within Kant’s time. The philosopher was directly critiqued by a rigorous empiricist found within Johan Georg Forster. Forster, who had sailed with Captain James Cook on his famous voyage, wrote to Kant, correcting his blatantly wrong empirical commentary on non-European peoples. Forester’s first-hand observations from &lt;em&gt;A Voyage Round the World&lt;/em&gt; presented a far more complex and human picture of Pacific and other indigenous societies, undermining the simplistic racial categories invoked by Kant. Within this encounter, one can observe a dynamic of the abstracting, classifying impulse of the foot soldier of modernity (in this case, Kant), being confronted by the concrete, experiential knowledge of the traveler-scientist (Forster). However, we too would be guilty of not affording another subjectivity, if we did not recognize Kant’s own evolution in thought. His later shift, particularly in &lt;em&gt;The Metaphysics of Morals&lt;/em&gt;, surely can be described as a change of heart, but it is also Kant being compelled into self-correction by the logic of his own system. In this text, here, the philosopher who once catalogued racial destinies just 10 years earlier, comes around and condemns the institutions of non-European slavery, de-links moral character with biology, etc. He now constructs an edifice of right (Recht) that methodically excludes such empirical classifications, and condemns slavery as a fundamental violation of the Categorical Imperative. Slavery treats a person as a mere means rather than as an end (in this case, as a rational being), and so would make Kant the biggest hypocrite if allowing for such an acceptance. Moreover, it would mean he is failing by the very same standard that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what prompted this move? The move which severed moral worth from any biological contingency has established the universal “person”. Anyone who is subject to moral law is defined solely by the possession of practical reason, a faculty which, in Kant’s mature philosophy, admits no gradation by skin color. What prompted this move, is a demonstration of our initial claim of universality, if true, having the tools to rescue itself. The power of a truly universalizing philosophical system outgrows the flawed particular inputs of its author. Kant’s early racism was stupid, not just ethically, but philosophically, as a non-universalizable particular that could not withstand the formal test of his own categorical imperative. His later work shows the system expunging itself of this incoherence. The abstract drive for a perfectly rational system proved stronger than the empirical prejudices it initially absorbed. In Kant, we see the modern consciousness beginning to confront, and correct, its own exclusionary logic from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hegels-africa"&gt;Hegel&amp;rsquo;s Africa
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of empirical contingency, Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; offers no such drawback. Within the majority of his work (barre what we will soon discuss), what you find is the lofty heights of abstract thought, the pure movement of the Concept. In other words, he arrives at his system deductively, unable to be tainted by empirical matters. This is precisely the appeal of his system, the fact that it demonstrates &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; what is necessary in logical form. His “racism”, so-called, is therefore a different order than Kant’s. It cannot be a biological prejudice smuggled into anthropology, because the very structure of his philosophy precludes biology, or nature, from determining or overdetermining Spirit (here to be read as the active principle of totality). Where Kant imports empirical racial hierarchies into his philosophy, Hegel’s Science of Logic (and Phenomenology of Spirit, although this does not offer any sort of key to understanding his thought and comes quite late in his system) develops a framework where Spirit is a universal potentiality. What this means is that there is no reality where biology, or any other contingency, effects the internality of a thing. Moral worth, in this context, can never be tied to biological characteristics. In a very rough manner, the opposite can be said, that the internality is what shapes the externality. However, this lends itself to needing qualifications and inviting misinterpretations, so it is better left unsaid. Regardless, what is to be emphasized is the universality of Spirit. This is why Hegel’s infamous placement of Africa “outside the compass of history” in the &lt;em&gt;Lectures on the Philosophy of History&lt;/em&gt; must be read not as a racial slur, but as a specific claim within his system. For Hegel, “History” is a technical term denoting the process wherein Spirit achieves self-conscious freedom and externalizes that freedom in the rational, universal form of the State. His assessment of Africa is thus a philosophical judgment about the development of a specific form of political self-consciousness. What meets the standard of entering “History” for Hegel, is for a people to find a universality, and spread it. This universality is a self-conscious universality (meaning there is a mechanism of self-recognition) where freedom is law and vice versa, embodied in the rational state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very existence of concepts like &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/em&gt;, which articulates a conception of mutual recognition, demonstrates that many African civilizations already contain, at least implicitly, a seed of universality. African civilizations had, and have, a substance. All people do. What&amp;rsquo;s lacking is full actualization through the form of a rational state and codified law. Every man on earth is self-conscious and relates objectively to others within a group. But for a people to come together and form a state — one that recursively enforces and mediates universal principles of right — requires the collective recognition of freedom as law and law as freedom. In other words, African kingdoms had laws and governance surely, so ethical substance is not lacking. The objective institutions of a rational modern state were for Hegel. This state is defined by its capacity to recognize all subjects as abstract, right-bearing individuals before a universal law, rather than as members of a particular family, clan, or tribe. This is the transition from customary governance to constitutional right. Now that the standard is clarified for Hegel, this methodology explains his otherwise surprising engagement with the continent. Unlike the broad, derogatory brush of his peers, Hegel demonstrates a specific (if not flawed and limited) interest in African societies, referencing Ashanti and Dahomey. He is attempting to analyze them through his conceptual framework rather than dismiss them outright. His framework even possesses a logical aperture for recognizing Black political agency, most notably in his positive commentary on the Haitian Revolution, where he acknowledges enslaved Africans attaining a “concept of freedom” and forming a state. Such commentary shows, in principle, that his system could register and explain such an event as a moment of world historical significance, even if he did not place it central to his narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it relates to the claim that the African has not achieved the necessary “distinction between himself as an individual and the universality of his essential being”, Hegel is correct on this specific, developmental point. The sharp differentiation of the individual ego from the communal and natural whole represents an advancement of stage in the evolution of consciousness. This is the truth within his Eurocentrism. However, this should not be mistaken for a prescription of the future. It’s a &lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt; of a formal stage which aligns with the development of Concept, or in other words, vindicates the deductive result of Concept’s developmental path by finding it in the world. To observe that a particular form of consciousness has not yet emerged is not to predict it cannot or will not. Hegel’s own comments on Haiti (such as written on by Susan Buck-Morss&amp;rsquo;s Hegel, Haiti, and Universal History) should dispel the notion that “Africans” will never amount to anything, designated into an eternal state of nature. In fact, his own methodology teaches that every stage is necessarily overcome. It is a fact that every subsequent development of what Hegel calls “history” becomes the standard, lest it be destroyed by the truth of a further developed concept. What is claimed as the “standard” or the pinnacle of development &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt;, in some way or another, adopted by all states unless they face destruction. Consider this metaphor: when playing video games, META is defined as the most efficient tactic available. Such a tactic is a novelty of action, if only to be replaced by another META. In order to succeed at the “game”, you either have to adopt this “META” strategy, or come up with ways to confront it, lest you lose the game. This is essentially what has happened with the state form and consciousness found in Europe and the resulting reaction by the world that we call “modernity”. It follows, then, that a more “developed” logical structure does not equate to a higher human worth or a “better” humanity. It only describes a capacity for a certain kind of abstract reflection and institutional formation at the time of description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel is right, in concept, about these aspects of Africa. However, having established that the concept of state is a logical deduction, we must now confront the disquieting reality of his &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of History&lt;/em&gt; lectures. Here, the unspoiled movements of the concept collides with the dirty, prejudiced empirical data of its time. In order to appraise world history, we need to use empirical data to trace the concept’s actualization in the world. We wouldn’t want it to remain an abstract schema floating in the sky, unable to enlighten us about what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. This integration with empirical data certainly doesn’t invalidate the deductive aspect of his system, but it does point to a failure in structural integrity, where philosophy is being supplied with biased missionary reports and colonial-era anthropology. You know, the kind of secondary literature available to a German professor in the 1820s, and so steeped in the racial ideologies of their time. As a result, when declaring “Africa” no historical part of the world, it is just as much validating a pre-existing colonial narrative with the authority of philosophy, as it is pronouncing a logical conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lectures present a series of mistakes, each fueling the next. The first is Hegel’s description of the African interior as an “unknown Upland” with no internal movement, where the “Negroes have seldom made their way through”. Such a geographical error erases the millennia of complex history including Bantu migrations, the trans-Saharan trade networks which linked Timbuktu to the Mediterranean, the dynamic empires of Ghana, Mali, Songhai, etc. By rendering Africa geographically static, he manufactures the precondition for declaring it &lt;em&gt;historically&lt;/em&gt; stagnant, missing the very same logical movements his own Science of Logic should have recognized as its own. The lectures traffic in sweeping, dehumanizing claims. Africa as a whole is painted as a place where cannibalism is customary, parents and children sell each other regularly, and there is “perfect contempt for humanity”, to quote Hegel. These tropes are drawn from the most sensationalistic and context-stripped missionary reports as the normative character of the race, when in reality, these were atrocities of war or famine. Philosophically, this serves the function of manufacturing an empirical proof that Africans exist in a state of mere sensuous volition, devoid of “universal spiritual laws” (like familial morality) that form the ethical substance from which the State immanently emerges. The brutalizing effects of the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade (which he &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt;) are then simplified as the essentiality of an entire continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the “African religion” is just as much a failure. Most noteworthy is the fact that complex monotheistic and cosmological systems, such as Akan Nyame, existed. Cosmic systems are reduced into sorcery and fetishism, arguing that the African “commands the elements” and thus has no “consciousness of a Higher Power”. Additionally, he describes the ritual interaction with objects. In claiming, “if any mischance occurs… they bind and beat or destroy the Fetich”, what he effectively does is interpret a ritual interaction with a mediating vessel of spiritual force as literal transactional mastery over a powerless object. From the standpoint of abstract intellectualism, such an act indeed seems nonsensical. The burden of proof, however, still rests on Hegel to demonstrate that this interpretation is the correct one, that at once all people are “rational”, and that a whole category of people are acting in a way you deem irrational. The steel manned position is that they are functioning in a way which is intelligible, and that you have yet to figure it out. Verily, the case has not been made; the possibility remains that the ritual described is an engagement with the spiritual being &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the object, and so is an act of communication within an ensouled cosmos as opposed to crude domination. Furthermore, the “higher power” in such systems is often immanent in all things, a pervasive unity of being rather than a separate abstract deity. To accuse such a worldview of a lack of divinity or higher power is to miss a very foundational coherence. A coherence that, ironically, is very Hegelian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging intricate political rituals (for example, he mentions the sending of parrot’s eggs in Dahomey as a check on the king), he categorizes all African polities as despotic, held together by external force and the arbitrary will of a ruler. He fails to see the implicit constitutional principles within them. The Ashanti Empire, which he mentions, was a federation held together by a sophisticated constitution named &lt;em&gt;The Great Oath&lt;/em&gt;, a representative council, and legal codes. Defining the State solely in its modern European, bureaucratic incarnation, Hegel in effect renders all preceding political formations, &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; those of Ancient Greece or feudal Europe, as preludes. However, he reserves for Africa alone the totalizing verdict of being on the threshold of World History, a present-tense exclusion. There is quite the inconsistency here with respect to Egypt, Chaldea, and India. For Hegel, these represent Spirit’s essential and revered childhood, but he frames their defects, such as the caste system, polytheism (which he accuses Africa of having), or theriomorphic gods, as necessary preludes &lt;em&gt;toward&lt;/em&gt; the Greek and European realization of freedom. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; are on the path, and produced monumental architecture, writing systems, philosophical thought, and so on that European scholarship could recognize as precursors to its own tradition, which it claims is universal. Africa is denied this dignified position as precursor. Its forms of consciousness are not seen as contributing to the dialectic, but as constituting a static ahistorical void beside it. The similarity in stages of consciousness are curious (from a purely structural perspective regarding the relationship between self and world, Africa and this or that cultural sphere might share similarities), alongside the valuation of a diametrically opposed kind. One is a noble beginning, the other is a nullity, a necessary “outside”. While one can argue the bankruptcy of a singular historical dialectic when confronted with the full breadth of human cultural forms, the correct line of argumentation, and what this ultimately proves, is that it is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; particular narrative. It is not a neutral logical template finding its correlate in the world, but a specific substantive narrative of the ego’s journey to self-conscious freedom as it unfolds in a particular cultural stream. This narrative, which finds its zenith in the modern Germanic-Anglo world and its “consciousness soul”, has no internal place for Africa except as a constitutive outside, a spiritual “state of nature” against which historical consciousness defines itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one can thus accurately term Hegel’s philosophy is not racist in any biological-essentialist sense of a Locke or early Kant. Their racism is additive, being prejudices attached to philosophical systems primarily concerned with other questions (governance and morality, although questions which exclude certain subjects). Hegel’s failing is much wiser. It is “structurally” Eurocentric. His system does not include racist remarks on the basis of biological character, nor does it tie destiny to biology or other such contingencies. Its very architecture, including what results in the trajectory of World-Spirit, identifies the unfolding of self-conscious freedom exclusively with the Greco-Roman to Germanic-Anglo lineage. Structurally, there is a necessary “outside”, or a natural immediate backdrop against which History is defined. His system presents a specific substantive narrative which has no place for Africa, except as an immediacy and externality within the subjecthood of Spirit, resulting from its characteristic mode. Africa becomes this unhistorical ground because of its postulated placement outside state-formation. The Eurocentrism described here is not a moral failing or even a correctable oversight. It is the very expression of the consciousness identified earlier as the systematizing intellect, which seeks to master reality by subsuming it under a single, logical progression. In other words, Europe &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the center of the world at the time, and in a sense Hegel is &lt;em&gt;rightfully&lt;/em&gt; Eurocentric. His genius was in giving this consciousness the most perfect philosophical form, yet his system’s inability to integrate Africa, except as an excluded void, highlights a limitation. What it does, is describe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; develops and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; a thing developed along a certain historical path. But it cannot explain why this development manifested where and when it did, or how other cultural forms relate to it as anything other than precursors, negations, or points along its normative development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious, even further, that modernity has “rescued” the status of Africa by claiming that we are all originators from this dark continent. Of course rescued, by providing leader assassinations, IMF and World Bank economic “adjustments”, and resource extraction. Contemporary thought, having internalized this Hegelian marginalization (insofar as Hegel is characteristic of the heights of this epoch’s attempt to make the world intelligible), now attempts a kind of rescue by claiming Africa as the biological cradle of mankind, placing it within “history” using the tools of empirical taxonomy and vague conceptions of society/organization. Yet this “rescue” often replicates the original abstraction: it venerates Africa as an origin point for the &lt;em&gt;species&lt;/em&gt;, while continuing to deny the continent&amp;rsquo;s own historical &lt;em&gt;subjectivity&lt;/em&gt; and political agency. Practices, such as the ones mentioned above, treat the continent as a non-sovereign contributor to the world, as a standing reserve of raw material and testing grounds of modernity’s tools of weaponry, propaganda, financial domination, and so on and so forth. The bankruptcy, is therefore not the single-line historical dialectic, but of the &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; historical content that has been inscribed upon it. This story cannot account for Africa because it was conceived, from the outset, out of its absence. This itself has profound implications, which I will elaborate on in future articles. Ultimately, the ask is not to discard the idea of a spiritual-historical development of man, but to seek a more comprehensive framework, while keeping what works. One which can integrate the rigorous aspects of Hegel’s system, as well as the different, parallel, and specialized spiritual missions of humanity’s various cultural streams. This is the point at which the critique of Hegel necessitates a turn to Rudolf Steiner’s anthroposophy, which posits precisely such a differentiated cosmology of cultural souls and epochs. Steiner offers a model where Europe’s development is one specialized task among many, in a collective human journey, thereby creating a schema where Africa is no longer the constitutive outside, but a vital pole in a manifold spiritual ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anthroposophy"&gt;Anthroposophy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to approach Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophy, one must first distinguish it from the theosophical context from which it emerged. While sharing a lexicon (such as “root races, Lemuria [which, if you are familiar with the name, proves my point. It was a name picked up by theosophists, which is why Steiner used the name. It refers to the theory regarding the proposed continent of Lemurs, then was adopted by theosophists to identify the third root race, only to be picked up by Steiner to describe an epochal Earth condition. I personally think it should be called Thermia or Pyria], Atlantis”, etc.), Steiner’s project has differences, some drastic, some minor. Theosophy, as articulated by Blavatsky, often presented racial and cosmological history as a sequential hierarchy of collective spiritual evolution, acting as a map of humanity’s past and future. Steiner, though initially working with this context, broke off from theosophy and began his own movement. For him, these historical and racial differentiations were not ends in themselves, but pedagogical contexts within a larger project devoted to the development of individual spiritual freedom and cognition. In order to do this, he developed a kind of phenomenology of consciousness and freedom to outline a path for the individual “I” to achieve spiritual autonomy. One can read Anthroposophy as a post-Kantian, post-Hegelian endeavor. One which accepts the critique of naive metaphysics and the historical development of spirit, but insists that conscious, methodological inner experience can extend the boundaries of knowledge beyond Hegel’s “Absolute Knowing”, into an active participatory comprehension of the spiritual realities, or the ideal world. His system is less a doctrine, and more a methodological imperative for the evolution of human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steiner’s most challenging, and most relevant, contribution is his model of human difference. To a philosophic audience, his statements on race can be reframed from what appears to be bizarre esotericism, into a historicization of the human form. His proposal is that what we observe empirically as racial differentiation is the surface effect of deeper, epochal shifts in the constitution of human consciousness and its relationship to the spiritual world. The main premise is that human consciousness and its embodied form are not static. They have evolved through distinct, qualitative stages. In earlier stages (which he terms Lemurian, Atlantean), human perception and self-awareness were configured differently. Overall it was, more immersed in spiritual and natural forces, and less individuated. The varying layered constitution of different groups crystallized around these different orientations to spirit and the world. Therefore, “race” is a phenomenon of spiritual history. It is a transient condition of the embodied soul, and a consequence of humanity’s collective spiritual past. This presents a few challenging questions in the face of the framework. For example, if one seeks to transcend race, how can they follow a model which provides such detailed, and &lt;em&gt;often times&lt;/em&gt; hierarchical-sounding descriptions of racial characteristics? Doesn’t this simply create a spiritualized racial essentialism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most central and valid challenge. A common critique labels Anthroposophy as a form of “spiritualized racial essentialism”. However, the system’s own foundational texts define race in a way that actively dismantles this charge. Race is explicitly termed a transient historical remnant, or a ladder to be used, and then discarded. The core ethical command for the system is the soul’s emancipation from racial peculiarities. Importantly, it institutes an ontological split between the development of the immortal soul and the development of racial forms. To mistake Steiner’s description of these fading forms for a prescription of identity is a misguided reading of a system whose stated goal is to render the very concept of race “meaningless” and form communities based purely on Spirit. In fact, Steiner predicted (it’s not so much a prediction as you could tell this would happen) that the end of isolated tribal lineages and increased “blood mixing” would herald the close of an age where certain forms of instinctive knowledge were tied to “unmixed blood”. This is not only to invoke the kind of miscegenation which conjures to mind modern notions of race (White, Black, Asian), but also to include the kind which has tribes in regional proximity to each other mixing (whether by domination or trade, it does not matter). The loss of these capacities was not a degeneration, it is to be taken as the clearing for the dawn of the rational age. It enables the possibility of a higher, conscious clairvoyance. By nature, this conscious clairvoyance is a spiritual strength achieved based on the individual’s development of the “I”, thus shifting the locus of spiritual power from the physical body (and biological contingency) to the sovereign spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial encounter with Steiner’s framework, that is, after the euphoria of finding someone whose project I could get behind, I looked deeper into his comments on race. The fundamental question I wanted to answer, and the question which will also be of importance to differentiating us from previous attempts at “universality”, is how is this different from Hegel’s Eurocentrism? Steiner &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; uses terms like “immediacy”. Hegel places Africa outside history as a state of “immediacy”, yet I critique him, and so isn’t there an inconsistency? The answer I’ve arrived at is that the difference is structural and teleological. Hegel’s judgment is a philosophical verdict within a relatively closed historical dialectic. While he describes a stage, he offers no internal mechanism for Africa to &lt;em&gt;enter&lt;/em&gt; History, except through the formative (and often times colonial) influence of Europe. Steiner is prospective and built on karmic/incarnational fluidity. The “immediacy” or particular spiritual configuration is a starting point for the soul’s journey, and not a final verdict. The individual “I” incarnates into a specific racial/folk context for specific learning, precisely to develop what is lacking. Furthermore, the entire framework is design for its own dissolution. Hegel’s Eurocentrism is a &lt;em&gt;conclusion&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, a critical philosopher must acknowledge the performative contradiction at play. Using the charged language of race in the early 20th century, no matter the intended technical meaning, inevitably invites the opportunity for misinterpretation and misappropriation, no matter how much one clarifies (and Steiner did. Multiple times, he has said that the races he describes in his lectures are not commensurate with the races we find in the world today, and moreover, that we are all essentially the same. The coming of Christ put a formal end to the significance of blood and calls on us to go beyond this contingency). The system’s intent is anti-essentialist, but its historical entanglement with the language of racial science means its effect in the world has the opportunity to reinforce the very patterns it seeks to transcend. Rather than this acting as a refutation of the operative principles at play, it is more so a sober acknowledgement of the space between intent and reception. The goal of reclamation, described earlier, is one way to navigate this space. Surely it is the one which is employed in this article, and one I will continue to explore in future projects. Nevertheless, to fully engage with the critique and assess this space, we must examine Steiner’s &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; characterizations of Africa and the functional role of folk souls within his cosmology. This will help us unveil the principles in his model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Steiner discusses what he terms the “African” soul-mood, or folk soul, his descriptions often center on a preserved relationship to spiritual immediacy and the natural world, words not too dissimilar to Hegel’s. He describes a consciousness less differentiated from the environment, more directly immersed in the rhythms of life and the force of the astral world. While the European “consciousness soul” spearheaded intellectual abstraction and ego-development (a process he described as both necessary and dangerous, I mean just look at the state of Europe and America today), the African cultural sphere retained a connection to a more unified, participatory consciousness. This preserved quality is not a relic in any pejorative sense, but a counter-balancing reservoir for humanity. Its mission is to sustain this connection, providing a spiritual counterweight to European intellectualism and holding a seed of perception that is key for man’s future post-intellectual evolution. This is the mechanism of the folk soul. In Steiner’s system, these are akin to cultural-spiritual ecosystems. Race provides a particular set of conditions, particular challenges, affinities, (a tendency toward intellectual analysis, rhythmic communal life, or maybe a nature-oriented perception). The incarnating individual “I” chooses, based on its karmic needs, to be born into a specific folk soul environment to work with those specific qualities. The folk soul is comparable to a curriculum, where the “I” is a student. The ultimate purpose of this curriculum is for the student to master, and then outgrow it. Therefore, to identify with the folk soul, or to love the transient qualities of one’s race, is to fail the assignment. Success is measured by the ability to lift oneself out of particularities, and integrate their lessons into a liberated individualized spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be noted that the cultural epochs named by Steiner are not these rigid historical cages which preclude other cultures and nations from success. We can look to the example of China. Within the anthroposophical framework, China is not assigned a singular, dominant epoch &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;. Yet China is not only a civilization of immense antiquity, and continuity, it is also a decisive global power, which is shaping the material and ideological bounds of this century. What this clarifies for us is that what seems anomalous to the model, does not act as a refutation. China’s trajectory demonstrates that the spiritual mission of a cultural sphere is to develop its own distinctive qualities, whether in statecraft or philosophy, across vast stretches of time. Its current rise highlights Steiner’s point, that epochs describe specialized developmental tasks and modes of consciousness. That an epoch is named for a culture only describes where this tendency most prominently emerges. Any idea which conceives of the cultural epochs as a “ruling of the world” is misguided, as is the conception of these cultural epochs as placing certain cultures and civilizations in the “dominator” role. History is, after all, a manifold of parallel and interacting spiritual phenomena, each with its own contribution to the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrines of reincarnation and karma are what change Steiner’s historic model into a pedagogy for the soul. Where Hegel’s totality unfolds through nations and states across world history, a part of Steiner’s totality, is the journey of the “I” across soul history through successive incarnations. Reincarnation ensures that the folk context one is born into is a “classroom” of sorts. A soul incarnates into a specific racial-folk environment (or classroom) by karmic necessity to balance experiences, or develop lacking faculties and the like. What this means is that the spiritual characteristics Steiner associates with a group are not essential traits binding its members, but are more comparable to a palette of potential lessons available to any soul that enters that environment for a time. What Hegel could only see as a fixed “stage” of World-Spirit becomes, in Steiner’s system, a recurrent experiential modality within the infinite curriculum of individual spiritual development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I am taking it as given the existence of reincarnation as a phenomenon, for the purposes of engaging with Steiner’s system. However, for those who remain unconvinced, it is worth nothing that this is not an arbitrary assertion. Serious empirical research into the phenomenon, most notably the decades of cross-cultural case studied compiled by psychiatrists like Ian Stevenson, or even the &lt;a class="link" href="https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;University of Virginia’s Division of Perceptual Studies&lt;/a&gt;, provides a body of anomalous data. This includes children with detailed, verifiable memories of previous lives, which challenges strict materialist/physicalist paradigms. This research does not “prove” Steiner’s cosmology, surely. After all, it could be the case that a subject is tapping into some collective bank of experiences and not in reality being that person, however, is this itself not a kind of reincarnation? What this literature certainly does establish is that the concept of reincarnation is not merely a poetic flourish. It is a genuine hypothesis with empirical backing. The framework of Anthroposophy offers one coherent way to make sense of such data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a clear relationship between the “I” and the temporary racial condition. Race is ultimately instrumental and temporary, and the “I” uses the racial-folk context as a learning apparatus. Let us give a concrete example of this framework. The Black American struggle, culminating in movements led by figures like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., can be seen a collective enactment of this anthroposophical principle. Here was a people whose racial designation was used to construct a brutally limiting environment of subjugation and exclusion. Their spiritual and political achievement did not find them identifying with this imposed racial identity, opting instead to master its most painful lessons and then transcend it. By invoking the universal ideals of personhood, equality, and inalienable rights, which were principles embedded in the very constitutional fabric of the nation that excluded them, they did not end up becoming “white” or European. They instead compelled America to recognize a failed universality it had professed but failed to embody. The “hierarchy” of race was invalidated and thereby ushered in a more universal standard of citizenship for all, effectively lifting the whole society out of the particularities of race each person finds themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the clarification that within Steiner’s system, to be born into a racial or folk category predicts nothing essential about the individual’s spiritual constitution, capacity, or destiny. The individual ultimately has their own developmental agenda. One soul may incarnate into a specific racial context to develop patience through oppression. Another may incarnate there to develop the strength to lead a struggle for justice, and yet another may be there to cultivate artistic expression from within a particular rhythmic tradition (hence the common adage of white musicians being met with “he must have been black in a past life”). No racial category carries a deterministic spiritual signature for the individual, and more than that, there is no significant spiritual content within “race”. The characteristics Steiner describes are tendencies of the environment, which follows that the “African” soul-mood of immediacy or “European” drive for abstraction are spiritual climates. But within each climate exists every conceivable type of seeker, thinker, and pioneer. The ultimate freedom of the “I” is proven in its very capacity to manifest in ways that defy any and all collective typologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In our age, primary attention should not be paid to racial descent but rather to the living impulse expressed in the words of St. Paul: Not I, but Christ in me.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;— Rudolf Steiner, 1911-03-07 GA124&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reclamation"&gt;Reclamation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preceding analysis leaves us at an impasse. The tensions within German Idealism and Anthroposophy, having traced their grand, universalizing architectures, have been laid out and confronted. The Afro-Pessimist challenge in this context draws an illogical conclusion. Discard the tools, for they were forged for your exclusion. Yet the different, more demanding, path has presented itself. If the works of past contributors to human knowledge can be compared to ovals, and we seek &lt;em&gt;the wheel&lt;/em&gt;, then the task is not to reject the oval and attempt to invent the wheel anew from scratch (ending in futility). No, it is to see the flattened sides of Eurocentrism and the non-uniformity of racial hierarchy as constituting our given material (holding onto the oval metaphor), and using the principles of geometric reasoning inherent to its creation, work it into a true circle. This is immanent critique, the application of a system’s own highest standards and rigor to correct its flaws, internal contradictions, and appraise the system as being worthy or not of reclamation. Hegel’s commentary on Africa (not touching on India, China, his thoughts on music, etc.) represents a kind of contingency which denies subjectivity and due process to Africa at worst, and completely mischaracterizes it at best. However, we’ve arrived at this conclusion using the standards present in his system itself and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; via a moralizing critique or external standard, this being the demand for a concrete universality that can account for all of human being. The structure itself has an unrealized potentiality, demanding that its claims of universality be made genuinely universal. Steiner has informed us that there is an imperative in spiritual emancipation, such that it clarifies that racial descriptions must be read as fading diagnostics and not eternal truths, certainly not the kind which makes the individual unfree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such projects are often met with skepticism. Why labor within frameworks that are supposedly scarred by the pathologies of their age? The answer is quite simple. A truly innovative thought or creation, whether it be the Categorical Imperative, the Speculative Method, or the concept of Freedom, does not remain the property of its originator, nor was it ever “theirs” in the first place. If it is genuine, it becomes part of the commonwealth of human consciousness. And nor is the genesis solely in the individual. When one finds that they are inspired, they truly are in-spirited. They have an insight from another awaken and resonate within their own capacity for reason and spirit. In that very moment, the innovation ceases to be theirs and becomes a living tool for creation. Likewise, as a thinker shaped by the West and standing in critical relation to its failures, I do not engage as an outsider. I engage as a participant of its continuum, claiming the right to separate the method from the madness. Likewise, each new world historical “innovation” of a culture becomes the new standard of the world, and the world must adjust. Modernity, did not merely &lt;em&gt;offer&lt;/em&gt; innovations, it established the new global standard by which all other societies would be compelled to measure and recognize themselves. The innovations it provides, such as the capitalist nation-state and the ideology of the sovereign individual, coalesced into a totalizing system. This system was then universalized by competitive necessity and of course colonial imposition. The world was re-made in modernity’s image, rendering all alternatives of being either assimilated, marginalized, or rendered historical. When a new world historical innovation appears on the stage, it will also alter the world, whether it be a change in consciousness, or a new technological paradigm (which will fundamentally alter our being such that it can be described as a change in consciousness. Take that how you will.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definitive proof that this reclamation is neither naive nor futile is in the history I’ve mentioned before: the Haitian revolution. The enslaved Africans of Saint-Domingue didn’t petition for entry into a French universalism that hypocritically excluded them. What they did was seize the universal principle of liberty itself, and through their struggle, compelled the world to witness its instantiation. Was this a “European” tool they used? Or was it an exposure of the European failure to grasp their own tools&amp;rsquo; logic? Haiti demonstrated that the most potent critique of a flawed universal is in its very enactment. In the same spirit, the work of immanent critique today is to take the various “ovals” of philosophies and frameworks and, through the application of their own very standards, work them into the circles they should be, rather than re-inventing the wheel. In spite of this, an apparent final philosophical test is yet to be faced. It is in the face of the claims of Afro-Pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Slave Ship&lt;/em&gt;, by J. M. W. Turner, 1840&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afro-pessimist position, mentioned earlier as being articulated by Frank B. Wilderson III, stands as more than a critique of racism or exclusion. It is a political doctrine that states that Blackness is constituted as the logical negation upon which the very category of Human, and subsequently Social life, is built. Blackness is not an identity among others that has been excluded from a pre-existing humanity, but is rather the constitutive outside against which humanity defines itself. The slave represents the ontological anti-thesis to personhood insofar as, following along the logic of modernity, they are mere objects in a position of social death, as opposed to laborers. “Social death” here, implies a position of &lt;em&gt;ontological&lt;/em&gt; exclusion from the bounds of personhood and relations that define social life. From this perspective, the “entanglements” traced in Kant, Hegel, and Locke are logical necessities of a world structured by this anti-Black antagonism. The universalism proposed by such thinkers are not unfinished, they are in actuality finished closed circuits from which their very coherence depends on the barring of Blackness. Immanent critique would be diagnosed as a category error, or mistake which has a logically impossible end. If the Afro-pessimist is correct, the not only is the endeavor of “not re-inventing the wheel” and reclamation difficult, it is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this challenge, one must begin with a concession. Afro-pessimism &lt;em&gt;rightfully&lt;/em&gt; describes the historical record and the failed instantiations of these philosophies. It provides the most cogent explanation for why the Enlightenment’s “Rights of Man” could coexist with the Middle Passage, or why Hegel’s World-Spirit could consign Africa to an ahistorical void, and why any universalism birthed within the context of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade (hereby referred to as TAST) carries the scent of death. Individuals such as Domenico Losurdo might have previously documented the savage dialectic of modernity, particularly of the Liberal paradigm and its grim underbelly. For example, it may seem paradoxical that alongside liberalism, you find the very illiberal policies of slavery, colonialism, genocide, racism, and so on and so forth. But AP takes this insight and recognizes it as an ontological principle at work. This principle is claimed to be that the concept of the modern human is born from the historical negation of the Black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the more perceptive among you might have noticed that I have avoided defining race in this article. This is another thing which Afro-pessimists are insightful on, the historical formation of the concept. The TAST was what &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; what we now understand as blackness, particularly as a category of what they claim is social death, as the foundational negativity of modern political ontology. The economic system of the modern age required a new pseudo-scientific (with the aims of justifying itself institutionally) taxonomy of human value. Thus, race becomes a category in the grand systematizing project of the Germanic-Anglo epoch, as an expression of its abstracting, quantifying consciousness. A brief genealogy of justification will show that the concept has always been philosophically unstable. Its justifications began with empirical taxonomy, retreating into metaphysical genetics (any grouping of what makes a race &lt;em&gt;a race&lt;/em&gt; becomes “begging the question”), and now it has circled back to a crude, pre-critical apprehension in the form of “just look, people are different!”. From its inception, race has been a problem of category error, chasing a material basis that it can never truly find. In essence, race can be defined as a deliberate confusion of categories born from the TAST. This must be distinguished from ethnicity, which is a perennial human reality (although just as historically contingent. specific ethnicities have not always existed). Where ethnicity concerns lineage and culture, race is a modern sign that appeals primarily to the epidermal character of man within a socially determined reality. This distinction is important since it allows us to recognize the Black American ethnicity, which is a real historically forged cultural identity with its own traditions, struggles, and ethnogenesis, as a creation &lt;em&gt;born from&lt;/em&gt; the imposed racial category of Black &lt;em&gt;in America&lt;/em&gt;, without conflating the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above are indispensable parts of AP’s claim. However, AP runs into a very big contradiction almost immediately. In its totalizing diagnostic rigor, it inadvertently replicates the very metaphysical closure it ascribes to modernity. It correctly identifies how modernity constructs the Human through the negation of the Black, defining blackness as a position of social death. But it performs a self-negation. It deprives the Black of historical subjectivity and potentiality. AP freezes the Black in the position of the object, the constituted outside, and in doing so, denying the very possibility of a conduct that is not always-already captured by the “grammar” of slavery. The very lack of a normative project is itself telling, insofar as for thinkers like Locke, their conclusion that blacks are inferior is a result of modernity. The very same can be said about AP as a modern verdict that mirrors the kind of closure it supposedly critiques. This“freezing” is especially evident in its engagement with Frantz Fanon. The notion of “ontological non-being” was extracted from Fanon’s work &lt;em&gt;Black Skin, White Masks&lt;/em&gt; by AP. The “zone of non-being” mentioned in the text is a lived negation to be worked through, resulting in the creation of a new humanism. AP’s reading freezes this moment into a permanent condition, disabling the Black subject. Compare this to the figure of Malcolm X, who exposes this rejection. He began with the same negativity. With the erasure of the slave name and the replacement of it with “X”, marking a new, open subjectivity, he was under no pretenses that he was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; constituted, in part, by a slave system. However, he used that negativity as the beginning of a new universality, moving from Black nationalism towards a broader human solidarity found in Islam. AP, in contrast, seems perpetually stuck at the moment of recognition, wallowing in this moment, seemingly inept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one may accuse me of ad hominem, the question raised by the life choices of theorists like Frank Wilderson points to a genuine tension in the unity of thought and being. If the anti-black world is truly total, and all cross-racial relations are corrupted by the grammar of slavery, what is the status of Wilderson’s own life and relationships? He is, after all, married to a white woman, and operates within the very “white” field of academia. In the end, AP’s greatest strength in its unflinching description of the anti-blackness found within modernity becomes its weakness. Elevating social death from a historical condition to an ontological fate builds a cage around the subject, denying them the tools of their own liberation, and in the end, in hopes of being a theory in the name of describing impossibility, ends up canonizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, my critique echoes Jean Baudrillard’s diagnosis of the postmodern condition. He argues that the masses respond to the overproduction of social and political meaning with a silent majoritarian strategy of absorption and neutralization. A kind of passive resistance that implodes meaning. Similarly, one might argue that AP, in its totalizing negativity, performs a theoretical hyperreality. Mapping the grammar of slavery with such exhaustive precision, its profound description of social death becomes a &lt;em&gt;simulation&lt;/em&gt; of that death, or in other words, a closed intellectual system where all potential resistance, or normativity, is pre-emptively nullified as either naive or complicit. Like Baudrillard’s silent majorities absorbing and deflecting all messages, the AP framework can absorb all historical instances of black agency such as Haiti, the Civil Rights Movement, and Malcolm X as mere epiphenomena within the unchanging structure, thereby neutralizing their significance. Put this way, AP does not merely describe a condition of impossibility, it performs a simulation of that impossibility, mirroring the very absorptive, negating logic of the modernity which it critiques. It’s a very poignant form of theoretical surrender. The depth of the analysis is mistaken for the finality of the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we should return to the initial question: how can we value philosophical systems built to be exclusionary? We have examined the architectures of Kant, Hegel, and Steiner in an effort to explore their claims and discover what is to be valued. The AP response is to declare these systems irredeemably corrupt, saying “we &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; value them”. Declaring the very tools of universal reason to be poisoned at the source by the ontological crime of the TAST, it renders reclamation of such projects worse than naive- it’s a psychological coping mechanism for those unable to face the void. I have argued that such a conclusion, for all its rhetorical force (perhaps forceful to a pessimist, maybe), is itself a profound error. It is a theoretical dead end that, in the name of critique, delivers an addictive reliance to the very totality it claims to describe. Against this closed circuit of impossibility, the open-ended work of immanent critique must be posed, finding its most far-reaching expression in the often-misunderstood system of Rudolf Steiner. While Kant and Hegel may provide initial frameworks, it is in Anthroposophy that we find a metaphysical architecture explicitly designed for the task of transcending contingencies. Anthroposophy does not shy away from the historical reality of “racial” differentiations, whether born from the TAST-era consciousness, or from before then. The ultimate goal is to dissolve transient qualities and create community based on individual spiritual maturity. This approach provides the tools to actively overcome essentialisms and exclusionary frameworks in the development of one’s own being. Therefore, the solution to the problem of exclusion is not to be found in AP’s passive cage. It is in the active, disciplined labor of working with what you have, in order to build what should be.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Quantum Realm or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love Metaphysics</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-quantum-realm-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-metaphysics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-quantum-realm-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-metaphysics/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images.amcnetworks.com/ifccenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dr-strangelove_1280x720.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Quantum Realm or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love Metaphysics" /&gt;&lt;h2 id="ideality"&gt;Ideality
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly perching on the precipice of potential, potentially perceiving a panoramic possibility, particularly of totality, perchance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never have I been mystified or enamored by the honey trap of a phrase, “quantum”. It certainly has a unique allure to it. “Quantum” physics, “quantum” mechanics, “quantum” computing, and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, for many who have caught wind of this, it seems to hold a position within their cosmology which was once held in high esteem by another sovereign: ideality. Quantum has become a catch-all term for wonders that materialism exiles, while also being built upon materialism, which is a foundation which lacks integrity. In reality, all quantum means is the general sense of quantity, with an implied scale of “small”. Physicists might be ready to jump the gun and vindicate the term, but &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; physicists will concede that there isn’t even a unified &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; of “quantum mechanics” (read: the mechanics of small things, such that classical mechanics does not apply to them) to defend. Likewise, it is in the best interest of science educators to clean up this train-wreck of a phrase. Unfortunately, most are interested in the institutional credits and clout gained from “insider” knowledge (which is ironically freely available online), instead opting to make fun of those that aren’t “in the know”, all while themselves being mediocre of intellect! Therefore, I will take it upon myself to write this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materialist scientism created a vacuum by dismissing “ideality”, which is the realm of non-material, structuring principles. Modern day institutional bias will hold this as unscientific ghost-talk. However, there are a series of problems which “ideality” solves, that modern cosmologies &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt;, placing them prior to the 18th century, which have at least confronted and, in some cases, overcome such questions. Ideality is not a given &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; in the world, it is the necessary logical and &lt;em&gt;onto&lt;/em&gt;logical precondition for there being a world of intelligible &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. It is the “domain” of form, determinacy, relation, meaning, possibility, and all things which make raw existence &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; a coherent reality. It is the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; behind all the &lt;em&gt;hows&lt;/em&gt;. More developed spiritual frameworks call this moment of ideality “spiritual”. Physics can tell you how a thing moves, but it cannot tell you &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; there is such a thing as motion, or why there is an entity which moves, or causality, let alone if these things are even justified to begin with! These are ideal structures which make any description possible. Ideality is the “one” behind the many, the “actuality” of potentiality, and so many more things. Ideality promises and delivers. It helps us answer questions which haunt the mind of modern materialists and physicalists alike. For example, it helps us bridge the noumenal-phenomenal distinction (or for you Christians out there, the Essence-Energies distinction). The phenomenal world is mere appearance, structured by our minds. The noumenal “thing in itself” is inaccessible. We are trapped in subjective experience! Except, we are not. The phenomenal &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the noumenal, as sublated. The true essence (Wesen) of a thing isn’t hidden behind its appearances, it manifests itself &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; them. Likewise, God’s essence, for the Christian, is shown through his energies. Kant assumes a rigid dualism. But the logic of Essentiality shows this is an unstable, immediate opposition. Ideality operates as follows: a pure, unrelated essence is an empty abstraction. It has no content. To &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; anything determinate, anything at all, it must manifest. Appearance likewise is not a distortion of essence, it is a function of essence as its own necessary self-externalization. The phenomenon is the shining-forth of the essence. Therefore, the noumenal is not a separate thing behind the curtain. It is the process of appearing. The truth is the relation between essence and appearance. The essence is essentially appearing. Ideality is this very relation. How about another example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this “tree-ness” a universal, or just a name we give to similar things that we call trees? We see countless particular trees. What grounds our knowledge that they are all “trees”? Nominalism, that only names exist, but not true universals, is hollow. It makes science a game of arbitrary grouping, mere &lt;em&gt;taxonomy&lt;/em&gt; (this is meant with derogatory emphasis. We do not like taxonomy here, we aspire to grasp the generative principle of things). The good news is that ideality bails us out. The abstract universal &lt;em&gt;tree&lt;/em&gt; is empty. The bare particular &lt;em&gt;oak&lt;/em&gt; is blind. The truth is the universal as it particularizes itself according to its own inner necessity. The ideal “tree” is the active self-differentiating principle that generates and organizes the particulars, while remaining itself throughout its manifestations. Ideality is this active, self-particularizing (or self-participating) logical form. Ideality helps us understand that the law is the genuine infinite that lives within and through the finite. Not convinced? Alright, how about one more example: consciousness. The “hard” problem of consciousness assumes consciousness and matter are two distinct substances, then asks how one produces the other. Ideality solves this problem by rejecting this premise as fundamentally mistaken. Consciousness is not a product of matter, matter is Ideality as it is manifesting itself externally in the world! Consciousness is ideality returning to itself from inside to outside and back. Matter and consciousness are two moments of the same process. The “ideal” is the logical and teleological priority of this self-knowing activity. Your subjective experiences are not and can not be an anomaly. They are the finite point where the universe’s ideal structure becomes self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Being-for-self enters the category of Ideality. Being-there-and-then, as in the first instance apprehended in its being or affirmation, has reality (§ 91); and thus even finitude in the first instance is in the category of reality. But the truth of the finite is rather its ideality. Similarly, the infinite of understanding, which is coordinated with the finite, is itself only one of two finites, no whole truth, but a non-substantial element. This ideality of the finite is the chief maxim of philosophy; and for that reason every genuine philosophy is idealism. But everything depends upon not taking for the infinite what, in the very terms of its characterisation, is at the same time made a particular and finite. For this, reason we have bestowed a greater amount of attention on this distinction. The fundamental notion of philosophy, the genuine infinite, depends upon it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;—Hegel, Encyclopedia Logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also bears good news for you Christians. It implies the redemption of the world &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="re-branding-ideality"&gt;Re-branding Ideality
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have such a principle, that the truth of all finite things is ideality, we can address modern intellectual malaise. What we find is an abandonment of this rigorous notion of ideality, but we are still effected by the voids it once filled. The contemporary mind has split into two equally misguided camps, both committing the same error, albeit in mirror-image ways, both converging on the same solution of rebranding the highest reality as found in “quantum”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materialism commits a sleight of hand, where the commitment to a closed physical universal forces a series of intellectual retreats. Everything must be explained away, everything mystical, that is. And so we have found that the miraculous and the meaningful have been transformed into coincidence as a result of being exorcized by probability. Probability is the tool of the materialist to explain away higher purpose, organization, and structure. Yes, the awe of existence becomes a statistical fluke. Everything that has ever happened to you? Coincidence. Had you done a single thing different one day, which would have resulted in your death? Lucky coincidence. Consciousness is an “emergent” illusion (emergent is another buzzword for the materialist, which points out a Point A and Point B and says point B emerges essentially by magic, avoiding the work of justifying the necessary connection between A and B). A loved one who was fond of butterflies has passed away and after their death, you reach out to them, only to be met with a vision of butterflies migrating? What a synchronicity! What we have before us is a philosophically bankrupt stance whose proponents perform a bait-and-switch. While publicly decrying metaphysics, they smuggle in unexampled &lt;em&gt;idealist&lt;/em&gt; assumptions through the back door of “quantum physics” and probability. When pressed on why the laws of physics are intelligible, or what even constitutes an observation, they implicitly appeal to a metaphysical framework their own materialism denies. Physics becomes a metaphysics by necessity, while this finite system parades itself as being a complete world-picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we have Spiritualism’s intellectual vacuum. Recoiling from the landscape of materialism, or more specifically, from this age’s mode of consciousness, but also lacking the discipline found in philosophy and pure abstract thought, the seeker goes looking for wonder in the wrong place. They latch onto the weirdness and mystery of quantum physics as a scientific validator, or authority, for pre-existing intuitions of total connection and ideality. Quantum is, for this person, a re-brand. A kind of magical incantation which is a hollow shell, albeit sounding science-adjacent, into which any vague spirituality can be poured. It is ideality for the uninformed and impatient, offering the thrill of the infinite without the hard work of either logic or discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From two opposing directions, both the rigid materialist, or physicalist, and the spiritualist arrive at the same destination. Both take the particular finite theory of quantum mechanics (at best, they just take the name) and inflate it into an “infinite”, using it to answer questions it was never designed to address. One uses it to preserve materialist dogma, the other to justify a spiritual yearning. Both evade metaphysics and ideality. The other side of this approach has an “equal and opposite reaction” (if we are to co-opt physics for philosophy). While both reach the summit in inverted ways, both perspectives also corrupt physics and spirituality at their root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the profound questions or problems of being, consciousness, and the world were met with disciplined, centuries-deep work. The intentional practices of spirituality, and the rigorous methodology of philosophy/metaphysics. This was the task of confronting reality in its full depth, which produced frameworks of holding the meaning all people seek to partake in. The “quantum” mambo jumbo offer a cheap counterfeit as a substitution. Why grapple with philosophical problems, or work to become a master of poetry and conveying truths, when you can just invoke “quantum entanglement”? Why sit and think through the metaphysics of good and evil, or elaborate on angelology and demonology, when you can just appeal to “quantum fields” of energy? On one level, everything &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; vibration and interconnectivity, but this means entirely different things for someone who has engaged with the rigorous conception of audiation as a universal phenomenon, or someone who has worked out the relationship between God’s essence and energies, than it is for someone who has not done the work to be able to explain what is meant. The “quantum” rebrand actively displaces and discredits the work of metaphysics and theology, while creating a culture that uses buzzwords as a crutch for a shared intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-metaphysics"&gt;How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Metaphysics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cease the apology. Be cringe and use the words which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; draw ire from the mainstream. Use metaphysics, ideality, spirit, and truth. Assert that things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; sacred. Stigma is just another word for intellectual capitulation, a PTSD by a militant materialism which doesn’t even know what it itself is claiming. Why grant veto on the deeper questions and realities of being to a mode of thought which can’t even formulate, let alone answer them, and as a result refuses to acknowledge they exist? Worrying about such stigma is the very mechanism that enables use of this “quantum term in the first place. Internally, there is a looming cloud of physics &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt; philosophy, and it’s not going away by being ignored. Physics is a successful enterprise for modeling quantitative behavior in the natural world (after all, it was initially called “natural philosophy). But it is &lt;em&gt;ontologically&lt;/em&gt; mute and thus requires a supplement of philosophy which, in reality, is what physics itself is a supplement to. Physics operates within a &lt;em&gt;meta&lt;/em&gt;-physical framework that it did not create and cannot justify. Assumptions about causality, uniformity, the intelligibility of mathematics, etc., all of these are not found within physics. Even now, so-called prominent figures in the field of physics are re-claiming the domain of ideality internally, since this is logically where an exploration of physics and engineering leads you (albeit in a form which is institutionally acceptable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must go even further and recognize that what is clumsily, superstitiously, inadequately, and disrespectfully gestured at with the “quantum realm” is, in all coherent traditional systems, recognized with the depth and accuracy it deserves as the world of ideality, or the world of spirit. This is not metaphorical. The determining principles of reality are conceptual, sure, they are formal, and in a sense conscious. The world of spirit is a manifestation of &lt;em&gt;Logos&lt;/em&gt; (Logos here being the objective, living formative intelligence of the cosmos, not a metaphor and not merely reason). This spiritual world is the legitimate and essential domain of inquiry, more fundamental than the physical. Physics does not explore it, it in actuality conforms to it. The laws physics discovers are finite, partial reflections of this ideal (and living) order. The fatalistic modern error is to take this reflection for the source. Beyond the mathematical description, or representation, is the determination it is downstream from. What physics records, spirit has already decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your journey through the quantum realm ends here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Significance of Thought; Thinking For This Age And The Next</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-significance-of-thought-thinking-for-this-age-and-the-next/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-significance-of-thought-thinking-for-this-age-and-the-next/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/David_-_The_Death_of_Socrates.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Significance of Thought; Thinking For This Age And The Next" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Death of Socrates&lt;/em&gt;, by Jacques-Louis David (pictured above) captures the moment Socrates, embodying &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; as self-aware reason, chooses philosophy (the self-examined life) and the grasping of inner necessity over external justification and dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;World consciousness has achieved a distinct stage of development characterized by a specific capacity. Previously, earlier stages found consciousness more embedded in bodily sensations, habits, and communal and traditional feelings. Now we find that the individual, having individuated, has developed a new capacity to turn awareness back upon itself. The Ancient Greeks identified this capacity with the term &lt;em&gt;Logos&lt;/em&gt;. Logos signifies the principle of order and self-aware intelligence that distinguishes human nature. It is the power that allows us to step out of an immediate being and say “I” to ourselves. The activity of this being which allows us to distinguish ourselves is found in the dictum, “I exist because thinking distinguishes me from everything else”. Here, thinking establishes the self as a distinct entity, separate from the undifferentiated totality of the world. Logos is this activity of self-recognition that sets us apart and yet connects us to the rational structure of the cosmos. What this means for the individual, is that the individual person no longer receives experiences from the world, or even their own inner life. They can hold their own conscious processes at a distance while examining them, coming to recognize them as distinct activities. The telltale sign of this stage is a detachment from immersion; the individual has the ability to separate themselves from the immediate flow of experiences, feelings, and even thoughts, to see them as &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; of contemplation. As a result, the individual sheds the immediate identity of itself with its experiences, opting to become aware of itself as an experiencer. A strong sense of responsibility for one’s own selfhood emerges. This responsibility is unified with the search for knowledge, particularly with the drive to understand the world and the self through principles, reasons, and truths that the individual can verify themselves internally. It may be permissible to repeat oneself in certain cases, and I’m surely not one who will pass off an opportunity to advertise themselves. So, I will take this time to reference my previous writings on this stage and its appearance in the history of man:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates is important here, since now that knowledge is not revealed through omens and oracles, it becomes elicited through subjectivity. Marked by the emergence of the Socratic method, where the subject looks outwards towards other subjects to see the correspondence between what is said and the internal coherence found within the ego, and the logical deduction of Aristotle (seen through the syllogism), what you find isn’t a total departure from reality. Instead, this moment serves as a translation of totality into conceptual form, where consciousness needs to grasp the relationship between the internal subjective act of thought, to “being”. In other words, the spirit descends into full self-conscious individuality, but at the cost of the split between the subject and object in its philosophic form, the form relevant for this age of consciousness/intelligibility. For the first time, man stood clearly as a thinking subject over against a world of objects to be known. Socrates asks “what is the good life” rather than asking “what do the Gods will?”. Plato asks, “Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?”. Answers to these questions are then sought within human reason because they cannot be answered in a way which generates inward necessity with myths and stories. And so, Plato’s Forms are intelligible to us as this new layer of man grasping the spiritual world in the mode of thought, rather than image or myth. What was once known as the Egyptian God Ma’at (cosmic order/truth) has turned into Plato’s Form of Justice, the abstract ideal discovered by mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this stage of reflective awareness, thinking (particularly in its matured, conceptual form), emerges as the defining central activity in distinction to the associative, dream-like thinking of earlier states. It is the disciplined activity of forming concepts, judgments, and ideas. Of all our inner activities - feel, willing, sensing, etc. - thinking is the only one we can observe while at the same time being its active agent. We feel &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; our feelings, and we are carried along by our will, but we can consciously direct and watch ourselves think. This makes thinking the most immediate and transparent process for the newly awakened self-reflective faculty. It is the first activity where the “I” can clearly catch itself in the act. This activity of thinking is characteristic of our current “stage” for this reason. In doing so, the goal is to overcome vague, subjective impressions. Thinking, by its nature, works with concepts like “triangle”, “justice”, and “cause”, that are the same for any reflecting mind, making these concepts universal. Hence, it represents a move away from the private, subjective world of feeling, towards a shareable, objective world of meaning. Additionally, the clarity and lawfulness of thought itself echoes this stage’s desire for a foundation beyond personal bias, having established the individual and individual thought as parsing intelligibility (and hence not putting personal bias in distinction with external truth). The very act of achieving self-reflective awareness creates an inner split. The observing “I” is put face to face with the experienced content (this may be the world, the body, or various experiential content like feelings). Thinking is uniquely the faculty which can can bridge this split between the subject and object. By thinking about my feelings, I understand them; by thinking about the world, I connect myself to it conceptually. Thought is the active power that seeks to heal this division. It is the seat of autonomous freedom, experienced as a self-initiated, self-guided activity. I follow the consent of my concepts, not a physical compulsion (and in the future, these processes, and faculties will be unified in such a way that it will cause a physical compulsion. What a world to live in, where an objective measure of justice is arrived at, and man is physically compelled to realize it). When one thinks, they are not &lt;em&gt;reacting&lt;/em&gt;. They are actively brining forth connections from within themselves, and therefore, the experience of thinking becomes the primary inner model and foundation for what freedom feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest for true freedom in philosophy has often been framed as the project of self-determination, or the capacity of a thing to act from the essential nature of its own being, as opposed to being &lt;em&gt;externally&lt;/em&gt; determined. Truly, any free thing can be called self-determining, and any self-determining, free. Our exploration of thought, and it’s destiny, for it to be genuinely an exploration of &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;, must approach thought on its own terms as a self-determined activity. If we begin by assuming thought is a byproduct or an effect of something else (such as matter in motion), we have already ceased to examine thinking &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; thinking. We will have substituted it with a different object of study: the physiological conditions that may accompany it. In order to understand the essence of thought, we must attend to what thinking itself reveals as an activity that follows the inner necessity of Ideas. Thinking is not causally linked to biology and neurons in the way that a physical effect is linked to its cause. Matter, as observed by the senses, and studied by physics, operates under different “laws” than thought. When I reason from a premise to a conclusion, the connection is made by the ideal content of the concepts themselves, not by an electric spark in my brain. As Rudolf Steiner observes, “Nothing is present for me by which to guide myself except the content of my thoughts; I do not guide myself by the material occurrences in my brain”. The claim that consciousness or thought are downstream from matter, is to establish that the correlation between certain patterns of neural activity and certain states of conscious thought is a causal relationship. But correlation is not causation. The consistent accompaniment of A (neural firing) and B (thought) does not prove that A generates B, since there is no necessary connection. It remains just as valid a hypothesis that B (a self-determined thinking activity) organizes or expresses itself &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; A, or that both A and B are two manifestations of something deeper and ideal. To assert the primacy of matter is a dogmatic assumption which finds no backing from logic, reason, or truth. Therefore, to give the phenomenon of thinking its due, we must treat thinking as it is. This means studying it first as a self-contained spiritual activity which we experience. An activity that connects ideas according to their own meaning and necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This activity of thinking reveals itself as what accords to the inner necessity of Ideas and Concepts. In thinking, we follow the connections inherent in the content of our thoughts. It is this very self-determination which distinguishes subject from object. An object is determined from without, a subject determines itself from within. The placing of this self-determination (of the “I”) finds its being in thinking. Within this activity, thought actively forms concepts and judgments, and grasps Ideas. Concept, to define properly, is the unifying principle that brings coherence to a manifold of sense impressions. For example, the concept “tree” is not abstracted from many individual trees, it is the ideal archetype that allows us to recognize any particular tree as such. Similarly, an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; is a higher more encompassing concept, it is totality, or in other words, a spiritual reality that thinking can intuitively grasp (return to this sentence when the phrase “intuitive thinking” becomes less foreign). The word “concept” itself, from Latin &lt;em&gt;concipere&lt;/em&gt;, to “conceive”, reveals this generative power. Thinking conceives, gives birth to, the object in its ideal form. Thus, the Idea is a spiritual being. It is a living, active principle that thinking engages. It is through Concepts and Ideas that the raw material of perception is structured into a meaningful, unified whole. Thought is the activity of achieving this unity, bringing the ideal into relationship with and making sense of the perceptually given. For more focus on what is called the “Ideal”, a short read is provided &lt;a class="link" href="https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/the-quantum-realm-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-metaphysics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="observing-thinking-versus-thinking-thinking"&gt;Observing Thinking versus Thinking Thinking
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ordinary course of conscious life, when we think, our attention is usually directed entirely toward the &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; of thought. Whether we are reflecting on a math problem, or planning our day out, the content occupies the foreground. We think &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; things, while the process of thinking itself remains transparent and unnoticed. The reason for this is that thinking is not one object among others. It is the very activity by which we engage objects. We don’t, in the moment of thinking, watch ourselves think. The reason being, the two activities, as the active production of thought and contemplative observation of them, cannot happen at the same time. This would be like a derivative of thinking - thinking of something, and thinking of that process. It is comparable to an artist fully immersing themselves in a painting, while &lt;em&gt;critically&lt;/em&gt; observing each brushstroke. Likewise, we can only observe our thinking in retrospect. If we want to observe ourselves thinking, we need to step back and turn our attention to the spiritual activity itself. By successfully observing thinking, we direct our attention to the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Mentioned is thinking. Including the capacities of feeling and willing would be seem unjustified, but it is worth noting that thinking is in a relationship with feeling and willing. In the act of thinking, we experience a feeling of evidence, or of correctness, when our thoughts align with their object. This feeling is not the truth itself, but it signals a telos, or an orientation towards truth, and a drive for alignment with being. Feeling in thinking is an inner compass that guides us towards adequacy and intelligibility. Thinking is also filled with will insofar as it is the &lt;em&gt;deed&lt;/em&gt; of Spirit, and it is the &lt;em&gt;deed&lt;/em&gt; of the subject. Thinking requires effort and intention. One can choose to consciously think about things, which shows a voluntary direction. Although, as mentioned before, most people think about things unconsciously. However, one can also willfully choose to engage in a conscious negation of thinking. Look to mindful meditation as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When philosophers like Aristotle describe a self-contained “thinking of thinking” (&lt;em&gt;noesis noeseos&lt;/em&gt;), or Georg W. F. Hegel who has one follow along with what thinking produces by thinking alongside thought, they engage in a process of logical reflection upon &lt;em&gt;the finished forms of thought&lt;/em&gt;. They take the results of thinking as it thinks itself, like concepts, judgments, syllogisms, and logical laws, and make these results themselves the new objects of a further act of thinking. There is, at present, a meta-level analysis. Aristotle analyzes categories and the forms of reasoning which constitute valid thought. Hegel’s Science of Logic traces the necessary result of the Concept through its own immanence and emergence in thought. In both cases, “thinking about thinking” means applying thinking to its own products. The &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; of thinking recedes into the background. What is really examined is a scaffolding of thought, a series of logical relations. This method treats thinking as a completed object to be dissected by a higher-order thought, perpetuating the very subject-object split such methods claim to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel is the figure most characteristic of this age of consciousness. He correctly identifies thinking as what elevates the soul to spirit. Steiner himself cites Hegel in the Philosophy of Freedom, saying “Only with thinking does the soul, with which the animal is also endowed, first become spirit”. Hegel’s core claim can be said to be that the self-movement of the Concept is the true path to knowledge, overcoming the subject-object divide and providing true knowledge. For Hegel, in the act of thinking, thinking and being are one. Spirit thinks itself. However, there is a silent perceptual act ignored in the schema. The &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; itself is done by a subject, and this subject is implicit! The embodied act of thinking by the subject is left implicit; the subject is left suspended until subjecthood immanently proves itself to be the one thinking. The problem is, methodologically the system ascribes to subjecthood, the incarnation of one unified Concept. True subjecthood is never arrived at, and as such, the freedom attained by the subject in this schema is one of servitude. Thought in Hegel’s schema is neither fully subject nor reaching object, merely describing the logic of these things. In other words, Hegel’s method produces one unified logical organism called the Concept, a totality which generates all meaning through itself. The “subject” (subject is in quotations, because true subjecthood has not been established) in this case is left with two options. Either align yourself with this organism (which implies a comprehension of this logical organism as constituting your own), or reject it entirely, which leads to non-being. This is essentially servitude, an alienated consciousness which does not know itself coming to the Concept, and the Concept saying to it “it’s my way or the highway”. Essentially, this is one of the reasons Steiner accuses Hegel of logicism, of fetishizing logic. The response from the Absolute Idealist perspective will present this accusation with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the individual’s act of thinking is the local manifestation of the global act of thought, that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the self-actualizing movement of Spirit, is the fundamental truth. The philosophical system is the journey where consciousness, or the subject, realizes this. The individual&amp;rsquo;s very existence as a rational being &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Spirit aligning with itself. Likewise, what is called servitude or slavery here is in actually freedom as the recognition of necessity. This is substantial freedom, the necessary outline by which freedom can come to recognize itself. The act of interfacing with this substantiality is true freedom, that this activity, after being objectified in the world, is accepted and comprehended as the subject’s own. The description is essentially true (as you will find with all of Hegel’s logical exposition), but the evaluation is wrong. There is a turn yet to be recognized. This turn is the full exposition of the “local” function of thought, an establishment of the subject’s activity. Through the &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt; of thinking, one makes a discovery that within experience, the thinking activity, though performed by the individual, follows universal, ideal laws. Through this method, the “I” recognizes itself as a site where universal ideality becomes actual. The “I” realizes &lt;em&gt;starting from the subject&lt;/em&gt; that subjective thinking is the substance of the thinking subject itself. This connection between the “local” function of thought, and the “global” will be explored later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at it from another position. Let us grant that the thinking activity of the subject is established as truly belonging to the subject, that the activity being done is magically drawn out from its implicit shell by the subject, into explicit view in the act of “thinking about thinking”. Although this would be counter to the system’s identification of thought as universal manifesting in the individual, let us grant the starting point that the subject is engaging in what Hegel would call “absolute knowledge”, bridging the subject with the object. This is for the purpose of demonstrating the issue with the logical organism known as the Concept. Imagine the subject’s power of thought as an expanding balloon-like membrane, that, through systematic thought, grows to cover the entire world as the system finds its completion. The outlines of the objects by this membrane are correct, shaped by the being of what they cover. Insofar as the subjective act is structurally true, it will find its correlate in the world. But the “thinking” of the objects are not themselves sourced from the objects. There is no true establishment of knowledge of the object itself, only its logical impression. Moreover, there is no true separation of objects, as the balloon-like membrane is one continuous surface. The “Concept” becomes a blanket that covers everything, but does not penetrate to the unique reality, or spiritual being, of each thing. What one would find is that the subject creates a world which is inaccessible to it. The “Concept” truly lives up to its name, since it is what births (hence conception) all knowledge in this system, and likewise, is marked and mediated by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be misleading to say that Hegel makes an error, since, all he is doing is adhering to the standard of thought as it thinks itself. But it would be just as misleading to not point out what results from the method. The result is that every mode of knowledge is either reduced to a stepping stone in the immanent development of thought, or disregarded as misguided or confused. This applies even to experiences which resist &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; conceptualization. Alien encounters, Christic visions such as in the case of John of Patmos in Revelation, or parapsychological phenomena (such as remote viewing and what is called astral projection) present content for which one cannot &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the generative reality. The Absolute Idealist would try to extract an ideal truth from the report, but this would not do justice to the experience itself, nor would it be extracting truth, instead locating the correlative Concept and picking and choosing which aspects align most with the logical exposition. This is not hearsay- Hegel’s system already has a place for parapsychological phenomena, classifying them as lower forms. He places experiences like “magnetism” and “somnambulism” (and by analogy all other extrasensory perception) in the section on Anthropology, before “self-feeling”. Reason and thinking judges them as yielding private, irrational content, and sees them as unfree lower forms of Spirit. In other words, there is no legitimacy in Hegel’s system of totality, for angels guiding your decision-making in order to save you. Had you done something differently one day which would have resulted in your death or injury, but, for example, received a dream or vision dissuading you, there is no room in the system to take this percept as it truly is. Fichte holds a similar view, naming the merely sensuous man as in a kind of waking somnambulism, or a slave to natural immediacy. These are ultimately inferior forms of knowledge, and subsequently freedom, seen at best as stepping stones. Hegel’s interest in parapsychological phenomenon reaches only insofar as these phenomena are empirical hints of a philosophical truth. One must ask themselves, to what extent can “Absolute Idealism” integrate perception, and what is the status of the subject?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="perception"&gt;Perception

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perception is ultimately any &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; content of consciousness. For Rudolf Steiner, the term perception (&lt;em&gt;Wahrnehmung&lt;/em&gt;, Steiner introduces the term “percept” in English) includes much more than its conventional philosophic and scientific usage. It’s not limited to the passive reception of external sense data like colors, sounds, and tactile qualities. Rather, perception designates &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; concrete content that presents itself to awareness before it is actively worked upon and interpreted by thinking. It is the raw, immediate “given” in any realm of experience. He states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I will call the immediate objects of sensation enumerated above perceptions, insofar as the conscious subject takes cognizance of them through observation… An emotion within myself can certainly be called a perception, but not a sensation in the physiological sense. I come to know even my emotions through their becoming perceptions for me. And the way we come to know our thinking through observation is such, that we can also use the word perception for thinking as it first appears to our consciousness.&lt;/em&gt;”
&lt;br&gt;—(GA 4, p. 62)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner experiences are to be referred to as perceptions, since they do not constitute knowledge, only the immediate &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; of reality. Steiner consciously broadens the term to avoid artificial restrictions. The full scope of perception includes outer sense data such as the traditional objects of perception (colors, tones, temperature, etc.), inner feelings like states of pleasure, pain, mood, and emotional tone, mental pictures (Vorstellungen) such as dreams, memories, fantasies, and imagined scenes, spiritual impressions (by logical extension, any intuitive or spiritual content that initially presents itself to consciousness in a form not yet fully conceptualized would also belong to this category of the “given”), and finally, the phenomenon of thinking itself. When we reflect on our own thought-activity, that activity initially appears to our reflective gaze as a perception, or something we find ourselves doing or having. In other words, a given. Perception for Steiner represents one half of a complete reality. It is the particular, contingent, and manifesting side. By itself, the percept is unfinished; it is reality presenting itself in a specific, isolated form. A mere aggregate of perceptions would result in a world of disconnected fragments and immediacies, which disappear as soon as they appear. Perception then can be considered the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; that is encountered, or as the question posed to consciousness. The developmental stage we are in is marked by its powerful capacity to grasp clear concepts and universal ideas. Its characteristic &lt;em&gt;pitfall&lt;/em&gt;, however, is to misunderstand the ontological status of perceptions. It subjectivizes them completely, viewing them as private “mental pictures” or subjective representations caused by an external world, rather than recognizing them as the other essential half of reality itself and belonging to the object, intrinsic to knowledge about it. This error leads to two dominant, albeit one-sided, worldviews. The first is materialism and naturalism, which takes perceptions (&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; sense data, since we live in times which denies ideality or a spiritual realm) as the sole reality, and reduces concepts to secondary, subjective byproducts or illusions. Here, only the perceptual pole is considered real. The other polarity is Abstract Idealism/Solipsism, which takes the conceptual world as the sole reality, and dismisses perceptions as mere illusory appearances within consciousness. Here, only the conceptual pole is considered real. Truth, full reality, or being, only arises in the active unity of percept and concept, or of observation (passive, not belonging to the subject) and thinking (the activity of the subject). The concept, or Idea, is the necessary counterpart to the percept, that provides its lawfulness, context, and meaning. Thinking’s activity is to seek and bring forth the concept that corresponds to the perception. A perception without a concept is unintelligible, and a concept without perception is empty. The task of knowing is to perform this unification, thereby healing the split between the self and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="observation-of-thinking-justified"&gt;Observation of Thinking Justified
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought has a unique nature, since it is the only activity where the observer and the observed are identical within the activity. Unlike all other experiences where we stand over against an object (like a pencil, or a memory), in thinking, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the activity we wish to know. Therefore, to know thought, we must perform an act of self-referential attention. We must, while thinking, turn our attention back upon the thinking itself. This creates a moment where the activity perceives its own activity. The only way to understand a self-determined activity is to experience its self-determination from within. Any method that treats thinking only as a finished logical product, misses the generative activity entirely. We may revisit the issue with the method of Hegel. While achieving a formal logical unity of subject and object, the act of the philosopher performing this thinking remains unexamined and never truly established. The system cannot describe itself as anything other than logical moment. Even when describing the unity of thought and being, the conscious subject is a blind spot. So, as opposed to “thinking of thinking”, we must engage in the observation of thinking in order to bring the subject into the light of consciousness, by addressing the question of who is thinking the system. In effect, we must turn from the content of thought (what thought generates), to the activity of thinking. In doing so, we achieve what Hegel’s system logically necessitates but cannot perform; we make the subject&amp;rsquo;s constitutive act its own witnessed object. This is the real moment of &lt;em&gt;consciousness&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Consciousness Soul&lt;/em&gt;. It is the moment where conscious experience realizes that it is the active source of thought as a concrete contemplation of thought. One does not think “about” thinking in general, one attentively experiences their own thinking in action. This yields true self-knowledge in that you encounter the active spiritual essence of your own “I” as the performing agent. Furthermore, it provides the basis for &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; knowledge. In observing thinking, you experience a spiritual activity that is self-produced, yet universally valid (which will be explained in the next section). This self-produced activity becomes the known “organ” for investigating all other reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, an exposition of thought, and the necessary move to explain thought has been established. Thereby, a distinction between “thinking about thinking”, and “observing” thought has been made. Absolute Idealism would hear this distinction and interject with an accusation: “This is a regression to naive immediacy and subjective psychology. You have turned away from the pure self-mediation of the objective Concept to stare at your own private, contingent mental processes. This ‘observation’ is merely a form of sense-certainty applied inwardly. It cannot yield philosophical necessity, only psychological descriptions”. The key thing missing in this accusation is that it misunderstands the object of observation. We would not be observing the psychological processes (like the images, associations, and personal feelings), but the pure activity of forming ideational content. When I observe myself thinking through a mathematical proof, the content is universal. The activity producing it is my own, and I recognize it as my own, yet it is guided by logical necessity. What the Idealist thinker does not realize is that they themselves use this same self-produced ideally guided activity to construct the logical system, but foregoes the subject for the universal subject, the concept. This Concept is what we are abstractly, and are not afforded true individuality as persons whose thinking activity is our own. The thought of the Absolute Idealist is absolute, and “global”, and for that reason it will remain alienated. On the other hand, this approach of observing thought &lt;em&gt;actually grounds&lt;/em&gt; the Concept in the conscious activity from which it is born. What is called the “pure self-mediation of the Concept” is an abstraction from the reality of thought as a living and embodied process that mediates concepts. Thus, the ultimate justification of the “observation of thinking” in contrast to the “thinking of thinking” is that it fulfills the implicit demand of Hegel’s own project. It achieves a knowing that is fully self-aware, and self-grounded, by closing a kind of performative gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: There is another accusation of “reflection” thinking which has been levied from Absolute Idealists, one that simply does not apply here. Steiner’s method of “reflection” constitutes an immediate self-observation of thinking as the activity itself. This stands in direct contrast to Hegel’s critique of reflection (&lt;em&gt;Reflexion&lt;/em&gt;), which he condemns as an external and ultimately divisive intellectual operation that forever chases its own tail, positing a subject separate from an object. For Steiner, reflection is not an external analytical gaze upon finished thoughts. The term reflection interpreted this way carries the bias of the alienated Consciousness Soul. It is actually the internal turning of attention that experiences thinking’s own active presence from within, in this context. Ordinary reflection cannot split ourselves to observe the observing in the very instant it occurs. Steiner’s method accepts this by not attempting to “contemplate contemplation” as a second-order object. It opts for letting the activity of thought occur, then redirecting attention to the just-experienced activity itself, not as a new content, but as a realization of the process as belonging to the subject. Thus, Steiner’s “reflection” is not an abstract division, it is a unifying recognition.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established the necessity and validity of observing thinking from within, we can turn to what this observation reveals about the essential nature of thought itself. In the act of knowing, we don’t act as passive processors of information, we engage in a self-determined spiritual activity. When we observe thinking in action, we discover that it is identical with the very core of the “I”. The “I” is not the body, nor the sum of feelings, or even drives. The “I” is the active subject that thinks. In thinking, the subject and its activity coincide, and so the thinker is the thinking. This identity of the “I” with thinking is the birthplace of genuine self-awareness. Here the divide between knower and known is overcome &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;, where we are the &lt;em&gt;producer&lt;/em&gt; and the witness of the ideal content. We are united with what we know. Yet thinking, for all its self-sufficiency, is not complete in itself. It is one side of reality. Thinking is the active, formative, unifying side of reality. To become full knowledge of the world, it must seek out and &lt;em&gt;unite&lt;/em&gt; with its counterpart. This other side is the given, perceptual content of experience, what previously was described as the &lt;strong&gt;precept&lt;/strong&gt;. A precept without concept is completely unintelligible, and a concept without a precept is empty and does not manifest in the world. True knowledge arises only with the unity of the two. Thinking is what penetrates the percept, discovers the concept that belongs to it, and in doing so brings the hidden ideal nature of the thing into consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking is a free act insofar as it is self-caused (both thought is free, and I am freely choosing to think), and it is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; activity. It is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; in that the connection is dictated by the content of the concepts themselves, and not on my subjective whim. There’s an important realization emerging. When I observe &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; own thinking, I see that the &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; is mine. Meaning, in its self-production, it is local and individualized. Yet the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; I am thinking, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the logical connection, or the mathematical truth, is not subjective of private. It carries a necessity and validity that is universal. As Steiner states: “The oneness of the concept ‘triangle’ does not become a plurality through the fact that it is thought by many. For the thinking of the many is itself a oneness” (p. 94). The content of my thinking is &lt;em&gt;not my creation&lt;/em&gt;. I did not invent logic, or mathematical truth, I merely discover these things. For example, two plus two didn’t equal four once I’ve thought about it. How can it be that this non-personal content is the very substance of my personal act? My thinking is only “mine” insofar as it is of my agency, but in its content and form, it participates in a lawfulness that is above me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;In thinking, we have given to us the element which fuses our particular individuality into one whole with the cosmos&lt;/em&gt;.”
&lt;br&gt;—(GA 4, p. 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjective act of thought cannot be a closed loop in this case. It is a localized instance of a universal activity. One does not generate logical form &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;; in a way I am tuning in to and executing an activity that is, in its essence, global. The local act is simply the individual performance. But the global act of thought is the very possibility of this performance. It is as if the local act is a performance of music, however the reality of the score is ideal. In the moment of thought — where I am fully active, yet wholly devoted to this ideality of thought — I experience that the activity powering my “I” and the activity constituting the ideal content are one and the same. Likewise, you do not think &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; a global thought (or, as Steiner calls it, a cosmic thought). You &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it. Your local activity is the global, or cosmic, activity, becoming conscious at the point of thinking it. The global function of thought is in fact the inner nature of your own active being, arrived at by realizing that “my” thought is not merely “mine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;What is striven for in this book is to justify a knowledge of the spiritual realm before entry into spiritual experience&amp;hellip; to show how an unbiased consideration&amp;hellip; leads to the view that the human being lives in the midst of a true spiritual world&lt;/em&gt;.”
&lt;br&gt;—(GA 4, p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process by which the individual accesses this global, or cosmic, world of ideas is called &lt;em&gt;intuitive thinking&lt;/em&gt;. Intuition, in Steiner’s sense, is the conscious experience, occurring within the purely spiritual, of a purely spiritual content. It is the act of inwardly generating or discovering a universal concept from within thinking’s own activity. Worth keeping in mind is that this process is not merely a passive reception of the ready-made Idea, it is an active engagement with the &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt; of a thing, and with the world of ideality (also known as the spiritual world). When confronted with a percept, intuitive thinking sings and brings forth the specific concept that corresponds to it. In doing so, it individualizes the universal. This &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; idea is grasped by &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; consciousness, at &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; moment, in a form colored by the individual’s unique standpoint and experience. This individualized concept becomes a mental picture (Vorstellung), or in the moral realm, a &lt;em&gt;moral intuition&lt;/em&gt;. Intuitive thinking is the mediating power that connects the local act to the global act. It allows the universal world of ideas to enter into the world, and enter into individual life. Through intuition, the thinker does not “apply” subjective thoughts to objects, he or she participates in the act of thinking by bringing the ideal content of an object into conscious relation with the given percept. The local act is therefore both mine and not-mine. It is mine in its performance and individualization, yet it is not-mine in its source and validity. Some may take issue with the term “intuition”, but it is completely justified. An etymological look will reveal it as literally meaning “in” (&lt;em&gt;en&lt;/em&gt;) and “to look at” (&lt;em&gt;tueri&lt;/em&gt;, as in &lt;em&gt;tutor&lt;/em&gt;). What other name is appropriate for the activity of grasping the necessity of an object&amp;rsquo;s unity internally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spiritual-activity-as-freedom"&gt;Spiritual Activity as Freedom
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task of intuition, or intuitive thinking, is to apply itself and become knowledge. When we seek to know something, whether it is a natural phenomenon, or a spiritual reality, or even a social situation, we are attempting to unite our thinking with the object’s thinking, or the objective idea which constitutes the object’s being. In other words, we seek to grasp the object’s generative thinking. In the act of knowing, we bring forth the concept that corresponds to percept. This process is a spiritual activity in its fullest sense. It requires the thinker to engage intuitively with the world of idea and to individualize the universal concept. The free human being is thus one who lives in such spiritual activity: thinking that is self-determined, moral action that springs from love for the ideal, and knowing that participates in the creative thought of the world. The ideal in question is not abstract and external, but a real possibility inherent in human nature. Ultimately, the man is not a product of nature or society, but has the capability to be, and rightfully should attain the status of, co-creator of reality. By developing the capacity for intuitive thinking, we become conscious agents of the spiritual world, realizing our individuality in harmony with the universal. This is the promise and the challenge of the current stage of consciousness. We must overcome alienation through self-knowledge, and recognize in ourselves the spiritual activity that is the source of both truth and freedom. Only when thought realizes itself to this degree, will we truly be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of thought is revealed in its potential to bridge the chasm between ourselves and the world. In our current age, thinking has achieved great power in analysis, but this analysis is a &lt;em&gt;loosening up&lt;/em&gt; of what was previously unified, by a new emergent capacity. The task is for this capacity to situate itself as constituting a whole once again; the imperative of the current age is to transform this analytic, observational capacity into &lt;em&gt;intuitive thinking&lt;/em&gt;, thereby establishing it as a true faculty of spiritual activity. Thought must evolve from a logic which dissects, into a spiritual force which unites. It must undergo metamorphosis from a tool of the alienated “I” to the substance of a free spirit actively participating in the world’s becoming. In this metamorphosis lies a sincere responsibility and our highest destiny, for the next age will not be built by bureaucrats, or by capitalists, or by scientists, or by calculators. It will be built by thought which loves, intuits, and acts, by those who realize that true thinking is the first deed of freedom, and that through it, humanity ceases to be a passive spectator of cosmic processes, and wakes up to being in the world. Thinking for the next age will build ourselves from within, and impel ourselves to think from within the living ideas that brings forth the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have it, some think they have it, some want it, and some think they want it. Intelligence is one of those things we claim to recognize but struggle to define. At times, we point to a clever solution, or an ingenious insight and say “&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is intelligent”, yet when we try to pin down the essence of what we’re pointing at, the concept fragments. In the modern paradigm, intelligence serves at once as a stand for three different things: an action, a metric, and a vague idea of inherent cognitive worth. Rather than being incidental, this is precisely the root of the problem. The cart has been placed before the horse. Employing a precise &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; metric - the IQ test - to quantify a concept that has never been coherently defined, we use the resulting numbers to retroactively justify the very definition we presume to measure. As a result, this circular logic has trapped us in a paradigm where we measure what we can, rather than seeking to understand what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break this cycle, we need to return to the source, and the key lies in the word itself, particularly in its etymology. &lt;em&gt;Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;intelligible&lt;/em&gt; share the Latin root &lt;em&gt;intelligere&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;inter&lt;/em&gt; (between) and &lt;em&gt;legere&lt;/em&gt; (to gather, to choose, to read). This etymology unveils intelligence not as a static possession, but as active relationship; the etymology reveals intelligence as the active capacity “to read between”, to discern patterns and meaning, thereby rendering the world intelligible. Intelligence is therefore a relational event that unfolds in the relationship between the subject and the world. To be intelligent is to engage in the perpetual act of interpretation, of translating patterns, symbols, and structures of reality, into a coherent meaning. The world itself is a kind of text, rich with potential intelligibility, and with mind as its reader. The two exist in a co-creative polarity: an intelligible world invites reading, and an intelligent mind searches for something to read. An intelligent being is one that can make sense of its context, and an intelligent world is one that can be meaningfully read. They are two sides of the same coin. This dynamic dismantles a dominant trend we’ll call the “banking” model of knowledge, where a conflation between information storage and comprehension is made. Surely the storage of information allows one to fashion from it understandings and readings, but the mere fact of acquiring factoids alone does not constitute an intelligent person. In addition to this trend, another trend is dismantled, one we’ll be calling the “processor” model, which conflates “computational speed” with genuine insight. True intelligence is not measured by what one &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt;, but by the depth and relevance of the connections formed in dialogue with reality. This relational view even carries a moral/normative dimension. The highest intelligence becomes a form of literacy, a capacity to read a forest as an ecosystem or living domain, a person as a history or living thing with a past and a future. The intelligent person is engaged in the ongoing project of rendering the world meaningful, and in doing so, participating in the very unfolding of its intelligibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective also reveals that intelligence is not the sole province of the conscious human mind. An object within a coherent system possesses a kind of contextual intelligence. Its very form and function “read” and answer the demands of the system (or mind) it helps constitute, rendering this mind stable, operational, and of course, intelligible. A perfect geometric crystal is an implicit argument of natural law. Its facets express, with an almost perfect logic, the mathematical constraints of molecular forces and symmetry, unified in the higher ideality of its intelligibility. The deepest form of intelligibility, or intelligence, is here a sense in which an object, or perhaps even a logic or pattern, which belongs “natively” (or rather colloquially) to a different system altogether, existing in the fabric of another. True intelligence, as the capacity to “read between”, excels at this cross-contextual mapping (and here I am to make a case for a resurgence in renaissance men and generalist education, but let’s stay on topic). Consider a very compelling example which came to me many years ago: take the case of a virologist who becomes an exceptional social media manager. Their expertise is not in memes, but in the underlying dynamics of virality. The conditions of a host environment, the thresholds of contagion, perhaps even the mutation of a message (which &lt;em&gt;translates&lt;/em&gt; to memetics), in addition to an intuitive understanding of pathways of transmission are what they are educated in. They possess a profound literacy in one system (biological contagion), whose abstract relational logic is isomorphic to another (informational contagion). As such, their intelligence is not demonstrated by storing facts about “trending topics” or “viruses”, but by successfully grasping the deeper intelligibility which interacts with and governs both domains. In this sense, the phrase “going viral” in the context of the virtual world has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more in common with the natural world than it may seem. This is the hallmark of true intelligence, grasping the intelligible form of a process so clearly that its echo can be discerned in a seemingly foreign territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The object itself is the solution to a problem, it is an intelligent object that makes the invisible structure/relationality of its context legible. If one would like to interpret the previous sentence another way, the heuristic in systems thinking: &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;the purpose of a system is what it does&lt;/a&gt; can serve us well. The object is in a dialogue with the whole. Life itself is this principle incarnate and active. A growing root navigates soil not by calculating as if it had the same kind of mind we do, but by being-there in a living dialogue with the whole of nature and with the whole of itself. Encountering gravity, moisture, obstacles, temperature, and more, it successfully reads between these variables of its environment to solve the problem of survival. An ecosystem self-regulates, and within this system, its species and processes are locked in a dance of change. Biological life cannot possibly be a passenger in an intelligible universe. It is itself a creative form of that universe’s fundamental intelligibility as a continuous morphing act of interpretation and response that perpetuates the very conditions for being read. This chain of intelligibility implies a culminating coherence: the most complete, self-sufficient, and all-encompassing “mind” or system, which philosophy and theology would term the Absolute, or God. By this same logic, this would be the ultimate intelligibility. It would be that in which all partial contexts find their final reference, the absolute source of pattern and meaning in which every subsidiary “reading”, from the smallest particle to the highest angels, coheres, and is perfectly rendered intelligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us return from the heights of this overview and demonstrate a more practical scenario. This model also clarifies a common paradox we find today: The person hailed as “smart” who fails to live up to their potential. This designation isn’t based on an abstract hidden quality, it is a verdict based on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; prior demonstration of a moment where they successfully produced an insight or created something. In other words, the only reason they are said to be intelligent is because they have showed it in the past, and the only reason they aren’t at this moment, is because of some disconnect between them and the world. Their very capacity created the expectation. Subsequent failure wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a mismeasurement of some internal asset, failure is what results from a breakdown in their ongoing relationship with the world. Perhaps a person is going through a depressing period in thier life, perhaps they lack confidence for this or that reason. Nonetheless, what this situation highlights is a moment of dialectic which constitutes intelligence/intelligibility. It requires both the capacity to discern, and the &lt;em&gt;concrete will&lt;/em&gt; to engage. To call someone intelligent is to recognize a pattern of successful past readings; to say they are wasting their intelligence is to observe a present refusal to enter into &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; meaningful dialogue. Thus, potential cannot be a ghost in the machine. Potential, in the context of man, is the unfulfilled promise of the relationship between a particular mind and the world it is capable of reading. The person and their potential are not separate, they are two descriptions of the same relational capacity, seen from the vantage point of past manifestation and future possibility. Truly, it is wasted potential for someone who has the capacity to be in the world and contribute to its intelligibility be plagued by either conditions outside themselves, or by internal ailments needed to be worked through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a surprise, then, that those who brandish the highest IQ scores are rarely the ones who change the world. Consider MENSA, a group defined by this exclusive metric. Its members collectively have not produced the defining innovations, art, or social transformations neither of our age, nor historically which have defined Western civilization. The common retort in defense of this metric is that world-changers like Einstein (I will grant that he has changed the paradigm of physics with GR and SR, not that is true) &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had high IQs, is a sleight of hand. It mistakes an occasional correlation for a causal necessity, while ignoring the vast majority of high-IQ individuals who produce nothing of comparable significance. This defense commits a few errors we will fully expand on later, but of which we can get a rough idea of here. Firstly, a conflation between the narrow skill of test-taking abstraction with the generative capacity and action that remakes and co-participates in reality. Secondly, it overlooks the essential non-IQ factors such as perseverance, moral vision, and the capacity to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; problems rather than solving pre-framed ones. Third, it cherry-picks historical geniuses post-hoc, using their legendary status to validate the metric rather than questioning why the metric fails to predict such genius in the living. This is not to say high scorers are devoid of talent, only that test scores capture a shadow of what’s required to really “read between” the lines of reality and “write a new chapter”, so to say. I suppose this clarification protects against the straw manned response of saying “Iapetus thinks someone with an IQ of 60 can change the world”. No, I want to problematize everything about this modern approach, including the biology-mind/IQ connection. Have you, for example, heard of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.3679117/scientists-research-man-missing-90-of-his-brain-who-leads-a-normal-life-1.3679125" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;French man missing 90% of his brain&lt;/a&gt;, and despite that having an IQ of 84 and living a relatively normal life? The world is bigger than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-contextual mapping of this kind points towards the idea that intelligence is not a bundle of separate, domain-specific modules, but a unitary core faculty. It is one unified foundational capacity for relationship discernment, and yes, problem-solving. What varies is not the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of intelligence, but the medium and level it works at. Given that this unified capacity involves the discernment of patterns of relationship, the artist and the scientist, the poet and the philosopher, ultimately perceive the same intelligible pattern in the world, but one renders it as metaphor and &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; which stirs the soul, while the other translates it into an equation or logical explication, which just as much may stir the soul, but nonetheless is conveyed differently than the former two. Moreso, the very reason our very “reading the world” transforms from age to age is not accidental. It follows from a necessary evolution in the way we make intelligibility intelligible to us in the first place. For if meaning was fully available in its conveyance at the point of contact, it would imply we have a proximity to the divine mind of God that goes in contrast to everything we know and can know at this point in time. It would be a totalizing knowledge entirely alien to the human condition. Instead, we don’t encounter the “whole” truth, we approach it through a succession of partial evolving perspectives, which themselves have a telos (which I will not cover in this essay). The intelligence, or intelligibility, of millennia past is in continuity with the one today. Each stage in how we make the world intelligible is therefore a corrective to the limitations of the last, and a step in the long awakening of the mind to its own implicit potential and to the realities it seeks to know.
We think we know what intelligence is. We measure it in numbers, rank it in percentiles, use it to categorize people, and sort or determine the worth of children and adults. What if the most “intelligent” thing you could do today is to recognize that everything we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we know about intelligence is misguided and, in some cases, harmful? What if the modern concept is not only flawed, not only a category error, but misconceived entirely and disconnected from the culmination of it prior to its current ~500 year long iteration? As you continue, this essay demonstrates that the fragmented phantom of intelligence we have today, is inadequate. Additionally, it demonstrates that there is necessity in tracing its disappearance from the universe, into the skull, and onto a Scantron sheet, in order to place it back where it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-history-of-consciousness"&gt;The History of Consciousness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If intelligence is the act of “reading between” the self and the world, then the question which guides our investigation is: “Where does this intelligibility come from”? For us modern men (and women), the answer is passive, mechanical nature. The “reading” is a private activity of our individual brains. However, this is a recent, and might I add, very impoverished answer. To grasp the full depth of our definition, we must recognize that intelligence and consciousness are two facets of the same event. Consciousness (from &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt; [with] + and &lt;em&gt;scire&lt;/em&gt; [to know]) is, simply put, our state of &lt;em&gt;being with&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, the condition of a being capable of rendering its world intelligible. Therefore, the history of consciousness is the history of intelligibility itself. Not the intelligibility of things per se, but intelligibility in general. In effect, it is the history of the evolving method of that rendering. Each cultural age represents a distinct schooling of the human spirit in a specific mode of “reading”. In the not-too-distant past, one would not say “&lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt;”, but “&lt;em&gt;it thinks in me&lt;/em&gt;”. This is since each mode is indicative of a different order of intelligibility than another. Likewise, our current “stage” or mode of consciousness differs from the last. In order to understand our current paradigm, we must journey to a time when the source of intelligibility was not found in the skull, but experienced in the world as a revelation from a living totality/universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Jean Gebser’s terminology will be used here and there in addition to Steiner’s terminology in order to describe the structural stages that characterize the relationship between intelligibility and consciousness. There is great overlap between what they describe, however they are different projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="indian"&gt;Indian
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; of man could make what it saw before it intelligible, the human soul needed to clarify the “that” of what it was making intelligible in the first place. The faculty necessary for the &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;-ness of intelligibility is the very capability to recognize that there is something meaningful to be grasped. It was the Indian cultural age which provided this certainty through an inward spiritual memory. It established the foundation that &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; is spiritual in essence. Without this anchor, all subsequent exploration risks concluding that the material world is the only reality. The Vedanta and Upanishads are fundamentally concerned with transcending the material world (Maya) and realizing the ultimate spiritual unity (Brahman), or ideal/total unity for you Hegelheads, through the inward turning and contemplation of knowledge (Jnana). The famous dictum &lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Thou art That&lt;/em&gt;, captures this age’s focus. The individual soul is not to understand the world, but to continuously remember and establish its identity with the universal “source”. Intelligibility/intelligence here is the intuitive recognition of a pre-existing, all-encompassing spiritual, or ideal, whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the first attitude of intelligibility is one of undifferentiated unity. Gebser would term this the archaic structure, where consciousness is an undeveloped embedding in the world. Consciousness here has not yet become self-reflective, it lies in an immersive state where inner “thought”, and outer “being”, or event, are indistinguishable. Meaning isn’t deciphered, there isn’t room for a stage of explicit recursion. Instead, there is a conscious anchoring in undifferentiated spiritual unity, which provides the necessary ground for all subsequent development. Without this anchor, man’s turn toward the world risks complete disorientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="persian"&gt;Persian
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stages of positivity always necessarily invite negation. What this means for consciousness, after establishing the positive unity of self and world, is that it must learn discernment. Zoroastrianism presents the cosmos as a grand battle between the spirit of light, truth, and order (Ahura Mazda), and the spirit of darkness, falsehood, and chaos (Angra Mainyu, or Ahriman. We will see him return later). Man here has a moral, or normative, duty to cultivate &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; creation (such as agriculture and truth-telling) and fight against corruption. An active will-centric engagement finds intelligibility discerning between good and bad in every aspect of life, and as a result, choosing sides. At this stage, existence itself is unified with morality, or normativity, from the perspective of consciousness. The notion that &amp;ldquo;being is good&amp;rdquo; can be found in various proofs today, but for it to be intelligible to man, it was first established concretely here. In Gebser’s terms, we would see the magical structure as dominant. We find that consciousness is enacted through ritual, rhythm, and eventually, a &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt; empathy with natural forces. Magical is the correct word here, since magic is the immediate attempt of subjectivity to control nature directly, without mediation by an objective universality. The archaic is a zero-point of “embedding”, while the magical, is marked by point-like, group-oriented awareness and a fluid, pre-perspectival sense of space and causality. This magical event characterizes the moment of pre-conscious differentiation, before consciousness awakes to narrative/myth in the next section. Steiner would correctly see this as the moment of dream-like instinctive clairvoyance (which has a technical definition in his system, although it is related to the everyday understanding) where the human being lived in an unconscious unity with cosmic beings, forces, and idealities. Both would agree that this stage is indicative of a profound connection, or unity, yet lacks individual freedom and the capacity for critical thought and critical self-awareness (which, of course, is implied by differentiation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better grasp the distinction between the archaic and the magical, the Aboriginal concept of &lt;em&gt;Dreamtime&lt;/em&gt;, has a direct correlate here, and is also reflective of Steiner’s descriptions of pre-historic consciousness. The individual and group are not yet fully distinct, and the human and natural worlds are bound in a web of participation. In Dreamtime, the Ancestor Beings, the land, the people, etc. are all part of a single continuous being. A person is not just &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the land, they are a particular &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of it, descended from, and in continuity with, the Ancestor who formed it. This description is a quintessential example of the magical-participatory relationship. Time is fluid, it lacks linear sequentiality, and so Dreamtime is not “a long, long time ago”, it is the eternal &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;everywhen&lt;/em&gt;. Ritualistic actions as a result are not commemorative events, they are actions which invoke a participation and re-actualization of the ongoing creative power of Dreamtime (and thus, like the moral dimension of the Zoroastrian belief, there is a moral imperative here of maintenance to the land), or of intelligibility and intelligence. However, it is also worth noting that there is some overlap with the next stage we will discuss, the mythic structure. Because the Dreamtime involves narrative and has this image-based quality, which is a hallmark of the mythic structure, it can be said to be a &lt;em&gt;preserved&lt;/em&gt; form of what Steiner calls “old Imaginative consciousness”, or instinctive clairvoyance. The good news is that this reveals that these structures are not rigid boxes, but interpenetrating states of being. Dreamtime stands as a testament to this fluidity, and so is not the “primitive” form of the later mythic structure. The core of consciousness remains magical, while its expression takes on a narrative image-based form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="egyptian-chaldean"&gt;Egyptian-Chaldean
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mythic structure is the stage where consciousness, intelligibility, intelligence, however you want to call it, awakens to polarity and rhythm. It expresses itself in symbols and images, or narratives/myths (hence mythic structure). The world is perceived as a drama of spiritual beings/idealities and forces. The participatory engagement of the Magical structure is crystallized. So it follows that the diffuse forces found in Persia coalesce into the images, symbols, and myths of Gods. Intelligibility is a matter of participating in a struggle here no longer, it is now concerned with decoding the divine language written into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on myth&lt;/strong&gt;: mythology often times has this colloquially implied meaning of “created” or fictional, but an etymological review of the word reveals mythology as &lt;em&gt;the study of what was uttered/spoken&lt;/em&gt;. The modern implication that these narratives and stories are all misguided, that, because they didn’t have the scientific tools we do now, they didn’t have the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;, assumes our ancestors were incompetent versions of ourselves, stumbling and bumbling towards a truth only we possess. For if they were so incompetent, the possibility of generating &amp;ldquo;superior&amp;rdquo; beings such as us surely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come to be. The steel-manned position of ancient attitudes would view them &lt;em&gt;at the very minimum&lt;/em&gt; as working with what they had at the time. It would see that myth and stories are not a failed attempt at our kind of fact, but a sophisticated vehicle of a different order. In order to convey important information (such as regarding the human condition, the universe, the moral order, or the great chain of being), a medium and method that does not risk the integrity of that message is needed which accomplishes these things. The ancients developed a peerless method here. Thus, the story and symbol serves as the perfect vehicle to convey such information. Statues, carvings, stories, and so on have the express purpose of preserving and imparting wisdom. The refusal to engage with this reality and reduce it to primitive fiction is not a sign of sophistication. Quite the opposite, actually. It describes a very specific kind of poverty in our own current mode of understanding, which is an attitude we will address later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptians and Chaldeans perfected this “reading”. The movements of the stars in Babylonian astrology (which also deserves a standalone article) do not exist as flat astronomical data. They, instead, reveal the will of the universe in narrative form. For example, the journey of Ra, or the drama of Osiris’s death and re-birth are not natural events we look to and find in the natural world using our mode of consciousness. They’re chapters in a sacred story where time is cyclical, among other things. Intelligibility is required to learn this “symbolic script”, a task for the astronomer, priest, or the initiated. This here is a historical demonstration of Steiner’s “imaginative consciousness”. Consciousness awakens to polarity and rhythm and perceives the drama of the world. The self, in the face of this drama, becomes a receiver and interpreter of these revelations, and moves beyond the “magical participation”, found in the previous age, towards a structured understanding of the world/universe, but still in an age within the paradigm where the source of meaning is external as a result of the early differentiation from unity. The source of intelligibility remains “out there” in the utterances of the gods, but the mind now actively engages in the work of its translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="greco-roman"&gt;Greco-Roman
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental shift from the “mythic” structure into the next (called the mental structure) is characterized best by the Greeks. Intelligence becomes redefined from a faculty of participation by interpreting the acts of external divine intelligence/intelligibility, to being the faculty of an individual subject which generates comprehension through its own internal logic. The myths of old are abstracted, then internalized &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; this individuated subject. This internalization is what Steiner identifies as the awakening of the “Intellectual” or “Mind Soul”. There is a specific layer of human being being developed here. The Indian cultural age is where the &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;-ness was secured, the primal spiritual memory of a divine reality, or ultimate intelligibility/intelligence. The Persian and Egyptian culural ages externalized this “that” into forces and images. Now in this age, the soul turns this inward to create a new instrument: the individual intellect/intelligence capable of abstract thought. The “I”, or ego, begins to crystallize within the soul and no longer needs to receive truth from the outside. It strives to discover truth from within itself using logic and philosophy. Socrates is important here, since now that knowledge is not revealed through omens and oracles, it becomes elicited through subjectivity. Marked by the emergence of the Socratic method, where the subject looks outwards towards other subjects to see the correspondence between what is said and the internal coherence found within the ego, and the logical deduction of Aristotle (seen through the syllogism), what you find isn’t a total departure from reality. Instead, this moment serves as a translation of totality into conceptual form, where consciousness needs to grasp the relationship between the internal subjective act of thought, to “being”. In other words, the spirit descends into full self-conscious individuality, but at the cost of the split between the subject and object in its philosophic form, the form relevant for this age of consciousness/intelligibility. For the first time, man stood clearly as a thinking subject over against a world of objects to be known. Socrates asks “what is the good life” rather than asking “what do the Gods will?”. Plato asks, &amp;ldquo;Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?”. Answers to these questions are then sought within human reason because they cannot be answered in a way which generates inward necessity with myths and stories. And so, Plato’s Forms are intelligible to us as this new layer of man grasping the spiritual world in the mode of thought, rather than image or myth. What was once known as the Egyptian God &lt;em&gt;Ma’at&lt;/em&gt; (cosmic order/truth) has turned into Plato’s Form of Justice, the abstract ideal discovered by mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very act of elevating the subjective “I” as the seat of reason created a chasm between the inner world of thought, and the outer world of being. For centuries, this split would be bridged by a shared belief in the divinely ordered cosmos in Medieval Scholasticism, whose goal was to reconcile this new capability of thought by differentiated subjects, and (the yet to be realized broadly transformative force) of faith. However, this bridge was temporary. The isolated sovereign “I” that Greece had midwifed would, in a later time, wake up to find itself truly alone, staring into the void at a silent and mechanical universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nighthawks&lt;/em&gt;, by Edward Hopper&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This painting is famous for being the visual of modern alienation. Figures are isolated in a sterile, geometric space, separated from each other, and the dark void of the outside street. The disenchanted world of the Consciousness Soul is captured with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="germanic-anglo"&gt;Germanic-Anglo
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivot into a mechanical universe is not sudden, it was the logical culmination of the Greco-Roman project. The individual “I” which was nurtured through the Christian Middle Ages with its focus on individual salvation and conscience, arrived at its inheritance in the Germanic-Anglo cultural age, or the modern world. What changes here is not the existence of the “I”, but self-awareness and the relationship to the world that this “I” has. In the Greco-Roman world, the “I” was born and begins to discover its power to reason about the world, in the same way that a baby recognizes that its hand is its own, and begins to play with it, moving it about and seeing the limits of what it can do. The Germanic-Anglo world finds the “I” turning its analytic gaze back onto &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; and upon the world it has systematically disenchanted. This is what Steiner would call the “Consciousness Soul”, where the ego becomes fully conscious of its dilemma - that is, being separate from the world. In Gebser’s terms, it is the deficient mode of the Mental structure. The radical subject-object duality leads to alienation and analysis-for-its-own sake, or fragmentation. Descartes’ Cogito is what identifies the pivot found in this moment. In exclaiming “I think, therefore I am”, the thinking self establishes itself as the only certainty. The entire external world, even the body, becomes a potential illusion. This is the “I” declaring at once its total independence, and its loneliness. Likewise, &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; individuate. Hyper-individuated consciousness can be said to be the engine of the Scientific Revolution, since in its very goal of mastering nature through the tools provided by the “I” (mathematics and modern philosophy), it was professing the struggle of rebuilding a world of meaning from its solitary existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligibility of this kind reaches its culmination in the project of Hegel, who, starting from the Platonic &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt;, produced the grandiose completion of philosophy in his system of Absolute Idealism. It was the most heroic modern attempt to heal the subject-object split that this age produced. From the immediate certainty of thought (the legacy of Descartes and Kant), Hegel wanted to show how the &lt;em&gt;ultimate&lt;/em&gt; intelligibility (Geist, or Spirit) logically unfolds through history and consciousness, reconciling subject and object, or man and the world in one grand structure, or in other words, showing how thought grasps itself and what follows from this development. He concludes that the Cartesian &lt;em&gt;cogito’s&lt;/em&gt; assertion of the immediate identity of thought and being ends up losing both. The Cartesian &lt;em&gt;cogito&lt;/em&gt; establishes only an abstract, empty identity between thought and being, which fails to encompass any real content. This creates an irreducible dualism between the thinking substance and extended matter. Ironically, by defining matter purely through the intellectual property of extension, Descartes’ “materialism” ends up portraying matter as a rarefied product of thought, thereby spiritualizing it. As for Kant, I have written in depth about the transition from Kant to Hegel &lt;a class="link" href="https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/from-hegel-to-steiner/#the-peaks-and-valleys-of-german-idealism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. While not exactly being the culmination of &lt;em&gt;Greek&lt;/em&gt; thought, Hegel’s project was the ending of the modern mind’s struggle in overcoming isolation. In this way, the solution that is Hegel’s system is instead a symptom of the very crisis it&amp;rsquo;s trying to solve. Absolutely, it is worthy of study, if not for historical reasons, then because of the strength of thought it develops in oneself if taking his project seriously. But as the proposed ultimate intelligibility of the world, it is in reality the most sophisticated and developed &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt; of the problem, masquerading as its solution. The drive to unify everything into a single &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; structure is the ultimate expression of the modern, sovereign “I”, asserting its intellectual dominion over all reality. This is the philosophical equivalent of the Scientific Revolution’s mission statement of mastering nature through reason, just applied to history and Ideality. His system is a staggeringly intricate, and at times beautiful, map of a territory, trying to convince us that the map &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the territory. In being the expression of the isolated modern intellect, it tries to generate cosmic meaning from its own logical operations after failing to find the necessity/intelligibility in the given myths and stories of the previous age (what he would call truth in representational form, or religion, which bears genuine content, but also of which the thinking subject cannot accept as valid since its necessity is not produced immanently by reason, thereby leaving the subject-object divided). Likewise, the meaning produced from the system, for example the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of life, is a shadow over the living reality of life, rather than directly receiving the meaning from the object in question, while grasping it internally as necessary and true. As a result, all claims from philosophy, with Hegel&amp;rsquo;s system of Absolute Idealism in mind, about the world end up being coincidental. Insofar as the structure of reason is true, there is a direct correlate in the world. But this does not equate to truly unifying the subject and object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having pushed the qualitative project of this sovereign “I” to its absolute limit, Hegel’s system did not resolve modern alienation. Almost immediately, the reaction to his system was followed by attitudes that dismantled the qualitative dimension. In the wake of Hegel, two attitudes emerged that cleared the ground for the quantification of totality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="materialism"&gt;Materialism
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was the objectification of the source, or subject. Thinkers like Ludwig Feuerbach and the young Karl Marx held that the “I” is no longer the source of meaning (Spirit) in thought, but rather a node within a larger web. Feuerbach’s claim is that Hegel’s Spirit is a projected &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; essence. The “I” is not the vehicle of cosmic reason, it is a being which is natural and sensuous. This reaction dragged the “I” down from the realm of pure thought into the sensuous world of biology and psychology - into the world of empirical study. Marx similarly said the “I” is not defined by consciousness, but by social relations and material praxis. The thinking subject is a product of economic and historical forces, in effect, making the “I” &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; an effect within an analyzable system of objects. It is important to recognize that the “materialist inversion” is the shadow of the Cartesian moment. Where Descartes’ isolated &lt;em&gt;cogito&lt;/em&gt; declared: “I think, therefore I am” and secured the thinking self as the only certainty, the “materialist inversion” proclaims: “I labor, therefore we transform”. It actually &lt;em&gt;accepts&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;cogito’s&lt;/em&gt; declaration of independence from a mythic cosmos, but reject’s its loneliness. It claims that the “I” is not a singular existence, but is in fact a node in a collective, laboring human species-being. This inversion doesn’t solve the subject-object split, instead it radicalizes the Cartesian instance of domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Slavoj Žižek observes in the Soviet ethos, the materialist project becomes “man’s domination over nature” (I could be misattributing this to him, although I think it’s fair to characterize the Soviet ethos this way). The Cartesian “I,” which sought to master nature (or the world) through mathematics, is collectivized into a historical “we” that seeks to master nature through industry and science through the social substance known as the Soviet people. In shifting the goal from individual certainty to collective control, intelligibility is no longer about finding meaning in the world, but about extracting utility from it. The qualitative “I” that contemplated and participated is replaced by the quantitative “human factor” that must be optimized and engineered. The “materialist inversion” completes the severance initiated by Descartes. It takes the sovereign subject and embeds it within a material system that the subject is meant to dominate, turning the gaze of analysis outward and downward onto the very conditions of its own existence. A dualism is at play here. The “I” becomes both the agent of domination, and a unit within the dominable field. This duality is exactly what makes the “I” ripe for measurement. To dominate nature efficiently, you must first calibrate the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materialist inversion, while some claim it to be radical, did not necessarily lead to the positivist world that gave birth to the modern concept of intelligence. By embedding the “I” within a historical struggle or sensuous human essence, it preserved the qualitative dimension, or a form of telos for man. Whether it be the liberation of the species, or the realization of man’s potential. Intelligence here is still &lt;em&gt;intelligible&lt;/em&gt; as praxis, taking the form of an engagement with the world inseparable from the enabling conditions which the “I” actualizes itself through. Meaning, the exclusive &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;-ness of will, community, and historical context. One could not isolate and score this on a sheet, since its value was in its very application toward collective and social ends. It can be rightly said then, that this materialist inversion presaged intelligence becoming a commodity of force in the world. It presaged the Ahrimanic impulse, the drive toward absolute immanence, materialism, and mechanistic dominion over the world. However, the materialist inversion was an impulse still tempered, no matter how faintly, by a humanistic purpose. And so the “I” was an object of science, but in the service of the social substance, and as a result, a grand transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="positivism"&gt;Positivism
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The qualities of the “I” can now be studied as objects. This is an important precondition for measurement. The second reaction to Hegel was the &lt;em&gt;positivist&lt;/em&gt; one. Rather than objectifying the “I” from the outside, there is a dissolving involved of its core &lt;em&gt;qualitative&lt;/em&gt; experience as a legitimate category of knowledge. The reaction is essentially: “Hegel wasn’t wrong, just meaningless!”. Positivists claim his project is a result of misusing language, or a product of metaphysical confusion. This attitude is also home to the attitude of thinkers who assume that because they cannot understand something, their lack of understanding constitutes the unintelligibility of that thing. The very fact that something &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; makes it intelligible. Nevertheless, according to the positivist, statements about “Spirit”, “the meaning of history”, and even “subjective truth” are completely nonsensical. Early Wittgenstein, in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, didn’t argue with Hegel, the action taken was drawing a boundary limit. Propositions could only picture states of affairs in the world. Everything else, everything ideal, like ethics, aesthetics, the meaning of life, and the nature of the “I” was unspeakable. It belongs to a category known as mystical. Sure, it could be &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; how one lived, but it could not be &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; in any logically meaningful proposition and likewise communicated intelligibly. It’s not quite a critique, more like a juvenile rejection of accepting that the domain of qualitative subjective experience is a field of legitimate knowledge. Hence there can be no private language, according to early Wittgenstein. Bertrand Russell and the Vienna Circle turned this into a ruthless program known as the “verifiability principle”. A statement under this program could only be meaningful to a subject only if it is either analytic (true by definition, such as logic or math), or empirically verifiable. It was touted as a guillotine for concepts. Under this guillotine, the head of Hegel’s Spirit rolls, as do all concepts like “the good”, the “beautiful”, and paradoxically, the “I”. Supposedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle of “verificationism” is perhaps the ultimate expression of vapidity. Ignoring historical and logical preconditions, it fails its own test. If only analytic or empirically verifiable statements are meaningful, then it itself, being neither analytic nor empirically verifiable, stands as a decree about the nature of meaning which lacks meaning altogether &lt;em&gt;on its own account&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, rather than refuting Hegel, it embodies the very same alienation that his philosophy aimed to overcome. Reason in this attitude becomes so terrified of reality, ambiguity, and the world, that it confines itself to a self-made cell of tautologies and instrument-readings, and call this the entire world. No, it doesn’t prove that qualitative experience is unreal. All it proves is that it is incapable of making it intelligible. After all, near the end of his life, AJ Ayer recognized this very critical blow, and admitted that he wasted his life on the movement, below @33:54:

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-modern-understanding-of-intelligence"&gt;The Modern Understanding of Intelligence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remained after the positivist reaction to the situation the “I” found itself in, after declaring the qualitative dimension of the “I” unspeakable, was a ghost. The living, meaning-seeking subject is gone, and what remained in its place was the “I” as a logical-grammatical placeholder in the level of ideality. The “I” is only a bundle of sense data and set of behavioral dispositions. Intelligence, stripped of meaning and participation, was redefined as the sterilized functional capacity for valid logical manipulation and efficient problem-solving. No longer was it a faculty for rendering the world intelligible, but a kind of processing engine which navigates rule-bound systems. The operative definition of intelligence is now “abstracted, pure cognitive processing power”. Now it is not the soul’s capacity to render a meaningful cosmos intelligible, nor is it the mind’s participation in something intelligible. Stripped of all content, this redefinition is the functional efficiency of a biological logic-machine. “Solve for x, complete this series, manipulate these abstract relations”. This intelligence is computational and decontextualized. The value lies in generating correct outputs from defined inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conceptual vacuum created an irresistible demand. If intelligence is a generic processing power, then it must be measurable and rank-able. The bureaucratic and scientific mindset, fathered by a positivistic spirit, simply can’t sit aside and &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; a variable called intelligence remain a qualitative mystery, and so, an abstract model requires a concrete metric. This metric arrives in the form of the IQ test as an instrument to fulfil the modern understanding of intelligence. It is the applied, institutionalized truth of logical positivism. The test design perfectly mirrors the definition. The only skills exclusively measured are analytical skill and empirical pattern recognition, which are the very same competencies the positivist “I” was said to possess. Morality, out-of-the-box creativity (such as test takers. What if you are smarter than the test makers, can a test accurately capture this?), embodied wisdom, and more are completely left to the wayside. An assessment is not made of how one &lt;em&gt;reads between the self and the world&lt;/em&gt;, all we have left is a standardized performance review of a supposed isolated cognitive processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test’s history certainly confirms its role as an applied ideology. Alfred Binet developed early scales as a practical, &lt;em&gt;via negativa&lt;/em&gt; tool to identify educational need. However, it was successors like Lewis Terman in America, infused with eugenic ideology, and positivist spirit, who transformed it into the &lt;em&gt;via positiva&lt;/em&gt; metric we recognize today. Such successors operationalized the abstract notion of general processing power (g) into a single score, claiming to represent innate, hierarchically distributed intellectual worth. In doing so, the foundational error of the test was established: the bankruptcy of conceptual value. With its single-scored nature creating a self-justifying loop, intelligence was defined as what the test measures, and the test was hailed as the measure of intelligence. The circular logic on display was grafted onto a statistical fallacy, treating the mind’s complexity as a linear trait distributable along a bell curve. The resulting test became the key tool for rationalizing educational tracking, immigration policy, social triage, social hierarchy, and so on and so forth, measuring little more than the proxy skills of test-taking conformity and abstract puzzle solving. These are the very aptitudes of the bureaucrat and clerk, not the visionary or the sage. Thus, the modern IQ test is the bureaucratic apotheosis of the eviscerated modern “I”. It is the ultimate artifact of a consciousness that, having lost the world and then annihilated its own qualitative interior, could conceive of nothing more meaningful than to assign itself a number. What we have before us, is a quantitative monument built upon the buried grave of qualitative intelligence. In this, it stands as the perfect, pathetic shrine of our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, it can be said that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; IQ test, the test which measures for intelligence, for how well one grasps intelligibility, is seeing through IQ test itself. To grasp it as a ritual for the modern age that reduces everything into Ahriman, into breakdown and quantification, is to pass the exam it is administering. In grasping that its numbers and patterns are a self-referential game, one demonstrates the very faculty the test cannot measure but is claiming to measure: the ability to read between the lines of a system or thing and discern its rules and non-immediate functions. The test rewards those who play by its rules. It satisfies the ego, and whole social environments are built upon it’s connotations. But it silently fails those who understand its irrelevance. The ultimate act of intelligence in the face of IQ is to perceive the boundaries of the instrument meant to contain intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="ahrimanic-gallery"&gt;Ahrimanic Gallery
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerve-sense system is the bodily correlate of abstract, calculative thinking. Ahriman (depicted on the top right as a sculpture done by Rudolf Steiner) works by hypertrophying intellect while severing it from feeling and will. The enlarged head symbolizes consciousness becoming cold, detached, and mechanized, where thinking dominates the whole human being instead of serving an integrated spiritual life. The marvel character MODOK (depicted top left) visually embodies the Ahrimanic imbalance Steiner warns about: a hypertrophied head (abstract, calculating intellect) mechanically sustaining a diminished body, symbolizing intelligence as severed from the other activities of the ego/I. Grey aliens (depicted bottom) repeat the same. Enlarged heads signify hyper-intellect, while small hands and bodies indicate the atrophy of will and feeling under a one-sided dominance of cognition. Note: this is not a claim that the above figures &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; Ahrimanic (well, aside from Ahriman of course), it is only to point out the forms they take express an imaginary coherence which signify certain relations between intellect, other activities of the ego, and embodiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="multiplicity-band-aid"&gt;Multiplicity Band-Aid
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with the devastating inadequacy of the monolith IQ score, for example its inability to capture creativity, wisdom, social skills, and morality, the modern paradigm does not reconsider its foundations. Instead, it performs the classic move of a failing ideology. It multiplies its errors and reproduces them. This is done by stepping back from the “one” score, and stating that in reality, there are multiple “scores” for the multiple “intelligences”. The retreat from the single “g” factor, to the theory of “multiple intelligences” is certainly not progress, it is the desperate attempt to preserve the core reductionist project of conceiving the mind as a quantifiable collection of measurable traits by fragmenting the trait of “intelligence” into more pieces when the original “concept” proves too elusive. There is a fundamental category error at play here. The domain/medium in which intelligence “operates” is mistaken for a distinct &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of intelligence. This is as ludicrous as saying there is a “hammering” intelligence, and a “sawing” intelligence, rather than the recognizing a source in both actions as a unitary mechanical understanding applied to different tools. The manifestation of a faculty is not a separate faculty, and so listing &lt;em&gt;applications&lt;/em&gt; of intelligence and pretending that these are in fact a result of the theory of the applicator is empty posturing. Not entirely empty, since it perfectly mirrors the fragmented, dissociated, consciousness of the modern age at its endpoint. Having first shattered the living world into dead matter, and then shattered the living subject into a solitary intellect, it now shatters intellect itself into a checklist of intellects. Hyper-specialization of this kind is the bureaucratic mind’s last refuge in the face of the problem of quality. If you can’t measure the whole, then you subdivide it until you can measure the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we must re-assert the unitary character of intelligence, grounded in our initial exploration of the concept. Intelligence is not six or seven different things. It is the &lt;em&gt;singular&lt;/em&gt; core capacity to discern. What varies is not the intelligence, but the field in which it reads (math, social scenarios, kinesthetic), the tools it uses (logic, ideally empathy, rhythm/awareness of the body), and the &lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt; one has with the previous two. The musician who perceives harmonic tension, and the mathematician discerning a numeric contradiction are employing fundamentally the same faculty of intelligence. The difference lies in the pattern and the mediums. Furthermore, the fragmentation is not benign. It reproduces and diffuses the same normative implication that IQ, with the monolithic “g”, did. The single-value model created a blunt hierarchy of intelligence. “&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; there are higher and lower intelligences, then it necessarily follows that individuals with higher intelligences should be valued”, whatever that means. Operationally, it acted (and continues to act) as a perfect tautology for those who wish to take its result and vindicate this or that theory of man and intelligence. In assuming a taxonomy of general cognitive worth (“g”) and designing puzzles to isolate and measure it, it uses the resulting scores as proof that such a taxonomy is real, mistaking its operational definition for a discovery about nature. The multiple-intelligences model, in response, creates a sprawling map of ranked categories. All it does is expand this process. It creates a taxonomy of separate mental modules, then designs domain-specific tasks to measure them. After that, it uses these results to validate the initial compartmentalization. In both cases, the test’s designs predetermine its conclusion. The underlying impulse remains unchanged, this being the compulsion to sort, label, then compare. Whether claiming a group excels in “mathematical” intelligence or lacks in “spatial” intelligence, the framework still traffics in the implication of normativity. It provides a more nuanced, albeit culturally sensitive, lexicon for that same old project of cataloguing human worth by type. This is the more polite 21st century face of the much older logic which believes that human minds can be definitively taxonomized, and that these taxonomies justify social and educational destiny. Generalities certainly do exist, but only as the result of &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;. It is never a revelation of innate type. The observation that populations exposed to generations of colonialism, resource deprivation, and the deliberate destruction of their own cultural-linguistic frameworks might, and generally tend to do, perform differently on tests designed by and for another population group &lt;em&gt;even within&lt;/em&gt; the same ethnicity (say for example an educated class versus a working class which does not have the same opportunity for education or resources), let alone between different cultures. At this point, the IQ test is a number which reflects the culture and access to resources one’s parents have. For example, to look at the lower average scores of Haitian and Somali populations and conclude something about “African intelligence” is to commit the gravest error of the Ahrimanic paradigm. The effect is confused for the cause. The cause is not a cognitive deficiency, the cause is the legacy of material dispossession, lack of education, and cultural disorientation. These generalities, far from vindicating a taxonomy of racial or ethnic intellectual worth, should be read as indictments of the very systems (colonial, economic, and now psychometric) that created the conditions for the disparity and then designed the instrument to measure its consequence as if they were its origins. To see the score and believe in something like this is to be fooled by the most insidious of self-fulfilling prophecies and out oneself as not having the capacity to make the IQ test intelligible to themselves. In other words, it is the sign of an unintelligent person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt; Cézanne here is painting the act of perception itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sovereign “I”, or the Consciousness Soul as Steiner would call it, is left analyzing a disenchanted world, leading to alienation as well as this understanding of what constitutes “intelligence”. If the modern error is to substitute the abstract metric for the living faculty, then any path forward must return to the act itself. The solution to the IQ paradigm, this current understanding of intelligence, is certainly not to design more abstract tests. It lies not in a refinement of metrics or further retreat into positivism. The answer is to remove proxy altogether. We must stop trying to simulate intelligence in a vacuum and instead test it &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; by evaluating the performance of the action that constitutes it. This means shifting our focus from the disembodied skill of “pattern recognition” to the more concrete act of, for example, deciphering a historical text’s latent causes, or diagnosing a complex system. Instead of attempting to measure “abstract reasoning” through logic puzzles, the test of abstract thinking would be engaging in the works of Hegel, where &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, or intelligibility is demonstrated in the faithful following of thought in abstract thought. In such a framework, assessment almost becomes inseparable from education and practice. You’d never measure a surgeons&amp;rsquo; intelligence with a paper quiz on anatomy (although I’d hope they know their anatomy). The assessment is done by observing it in the theater and viewing how the surgeon integrates knowledge and sensorimotor skills, with on-the-fly Judgment under pressure. Nor would you measure the capability of a basketball player in playing basketball with their squat and push-up limits. You would assess them by &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; the activity of interacting with a ball. Intelligence as being the capacity to make things intelligible can only be authentically evaluated when it is engaged in the actual work of rendering a real context and content intelligible. The move from abstracted metric to enaction is the first step out of Ahriman’s cage of quantification, since it respects intelligence for what it is as a relational event.
What the future of intelligence necessarily requires is to go beyond the paradigm of this kind of measurement altogether and into a comprehensive reintegration. Firstly, a healing of the subject-object split that defines modern consciousness is needed. The individuated “I” (subject), having fully won its sovereignty, must freely choose to reunite with the world (object) in partnership. The goal is to retain the modern ego’s clarity and analytical power, while shedding its alienation from the world and thereby regaining a participatory, living connection to the world. In the future, intelligence will no longer be a number on a sheet, it will be recognized once against as a quality of relationship manifest in action and creation. The future of intelligence advances to what Rudolf Steiner foresaw as the next stage of consciousness: the development of the spirit-self. In the future, the status of the conscious “I” transforms. Having fully secured its individuality and analytical power through the modern “consciousness soul”, it will now turn these capacities outward with a new intention.
The “I” will not experience itself as a spectator locked inside a skull, observing a dead, mechanical, world outside its grasp. Through disciplined inner development, consciousness can &lt;em&gt;and will&lt;/em&gt; evolve to perceive the living ideas and spiritual forces actively shaping the world. In this act of perception, there is a transcendence of the passive observation of sense-certainty. It begins with meticulous phenomenological attention to the object. Whether it be a plant or a social dynamic, it does not matter, what matters is not interpreting the thing in front of you as a dead thing, but as a dynamic appearance. The observer then actively engages in a process of participatory thinking, striving to trace the living idea, or spiritual form, manifesting through the phenomenon. One does not impose external theory here. Through a disciplined imagination (which has a specific definition for Steiner), one follows the logic of the object’s own becoming. The questions asked are not along the lines of “what causes it?”, they are asking along the lines of “What is its inherent necessity? What spiritual form reveals itself as this particular phenomenal form?”. In doing so, the thinker’s consciousness aligns with the generative principle of the object. The subject no longer stands in opposition to a foreign object. By thinking the object&amp;rsquo;s own formative reality from within, the act of perception becomes the very medium in which the object’s essentiality is realized. The subject-object split is healed in this activity. The subject’s perceiving &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the object’s self-disclosure. Thus, a mental illness is not reduced to neural correlates, but understood as a coherent, albeit pathological, shape of meaning and living experience, whose necessity can be discerned in its own terms. True intelligence, now and in the next age, is the capacity for this kind of perception, where the mode of intelligibility consciousness takes is characterized by uniting with the intelligible form in the act of its apprehension, thereby finding the self back into the world, where it never really left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our long examination of intelligence has concluded with a reorientation of an old definition. We traced the phantom of our modern intelligence from its origins as an act of making things intelligible to us, to its imprisonment as a quantified score, a journey which mirrors consciousness’s own evolution into the alienated sovereign “I”. IQ, in addition to being a flawed metric, is the perfect character of this deeper spiritual crisis. It is an artifact of a consciousness that has disenchanted the world, and now, in its loneliness, can conceive of no higher purpose than assigning itself an empty label. However, as the crisis reveals a disease, it also reveals a cure. The future of intelligence calls us not to invent a new test or metric, but to undertake a new kind of literacy that renders ourselves intelligible to a universe that is, and always has been, profoundly intelligible. It invites us to step into dialogue with the world, where the most intelligent thing you can do is participate in a mutual revelation of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Toward a Phenomenology of Political Conflict: An Exegesis of the Constituted Lifeworlds of Left and Right and the Fundamental Architecture of Division in the American Polity</title><link>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/toward-a-phenomenology-of-political-conflict-an-exegesis-of-the-constituted-lifeworlds-of-left-and-right-and-the-fundamental-architecture-of-division-in-the-american-polity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goddesscameo.github.io/p/toward-a-phenomenology-of-political-conflict-an-exegesis-of-the-constituted-lifeworlds-of-left-and-right-and-the-fundamental-architecture-of-division-in-the-american-polity/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary-alt:20210118170704-60999-mediumThumb-49198fig6_1.jpg?pub-status=live" alt="Featured image of post Toward a Phenomenology of Political Conflict: An Exegesis of the Constituted Lifeworlds of Left and Right and the Fundamental Architecture of Division in the American Polity" /&gt;&lt;h2 id="wip-article"&gt;WIP article
